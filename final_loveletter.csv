"My experience with several brands of space heaters in my own garage has led me to recommend the Doe unit. This heater comes in several output levels and seems to produce the most heat for the least electricity. I have used one for over 10 years with no maintenance problems, so I can recommend it very highly. Please let me know if you want me to go ahead and order the five units we would need for your warehouse. ",0
"I have never encountered someone as radiant, or as beautiful, and as kind as you are. The mere sight of you, the simple hint of your voice, quickens my pulse and awakens hope and wonder in me. I never imagined someone could be so open or so caring. Every day, I feel grateful for just having met you.You are full of life. Your personality is so vibrant and unique. I want to discover everything there is to understand about you. In truth, I can no longer envision my life without you. Although our paths are new and our tracks are fresh, our first steps together have reassured me of one thing: I wish to have you next to me always. I wish to spend my life with you.",1
"I fall in love even more with you with every second. Tell me, what magic spell did you cast on me?",1
"Word on the street says you are laid up with bronchitis. I'm glad to hear you are taking it easy. Something like that can too easily become more serious, and we need you around for the family volleyball games. If there is anything Jane or I can do to help out, please let us know--and don't be shy. I could help with some of your errands after 6:00. Please heed our request and get well soon! ",0
"The strong desire that you had for me seems gone. I feel like you do not need me that way anymore; that you just want a family with no strings attached. And it seems that you no longer want or need intimacy which is so important in our marriage. We had many moments earlier in our marriage where we definitely had the need to share ourselves and I miss that intimacy. There does not seem to be enough loving. Have you lost all physical desire for me? I hope not.If there is something that I can do to rekindle our love, please help me to understand. As I have said many times, I am willing to listen to your needs. All that I ask is that you tell me what you need and that you listen to my needs as well.",1
"It was a sobering moment when I learned you were giving me the award for youth leadership. I have wanted very much to help the young people of our community, and this award suggests that perhaps I have succeeded in some measure. I sincerely hope that is the case. Although we feel a little self-conscious about the attention we are receiving, Jane and I will be delighted to join you at the annual banquet on Friday, June 30, and I will be happy to respond with a brief acceptance speech. I have enclosed the recent photograph that you requested. It is difficult for me to express how much your thoughtfulness means to me. Thank you, again. ",0
"Since you came into my life, I have been so happy. The fact that we're a thousand miles apart is not a problem at all because you are always in my heart. You told me that I'm the right one, and I cannot tell you how good that made me feel. I am waiting for the days to come that will make our dreams come true. I'll wait for you for a lifetime if you want me to. Do you know why? Because you are the only one who sees me when I am invisible to others. I hope you never quit believing that my love for you is true.",1
"I have fallen in love so many times in life. But every time, it was with you!",1
I was lost and hopeless. But I kept praying for a savior to come into my life. God accepted my prayer and sent you. Now I owe you my life for eternity. Loving you madly is the only thing I can do perfectly!,1
"I want you to know that Jane is one of our most valued employees. She is bright, cheerful, and gets along well with even the most difficult personalities. She always comes to work full of enthusiasm, ready to take on new challenges, and eager to share her insights. You deserve to be very proud of her. If her qualities are indicative of what her parents are like, then you must be very special. Jane is fortunate to have such a supportive family. Thank you for your contribution to Jane's success at Doe Corporation. ",0
"My darling, Do not imagine, because you find these lines in your journal that I have been trespassing.  You know I have not – and where else shall  I leave a love letter?  For I long to write you a love-letter tonight. You are all about me – I seem to breathe you, hear you, feel you in me and of me. What am I doing here?  You are away.  I have seen you in the train, at the station, driving up, sitting in the lamplight, talking,  greeting people, washing your hands…  And I am here – in your tent – sitting at your table. There are some wall-flower petals on the table and a dead match, a blue pencil and a Magdeburgische Zeitung.  I am just as much at  home as they. When dusk came, flowing up the silent garden, lapping against the blind windows, my first and last terror started up.  I was making  some coffee in the kitchen.  It was so violent, so dreadful I put down the coffee pot – and simply ran away – ran ran out of the studio  and up the street with my bag under one arm and a block of writing paper and a pen under the other.  I felt that if I could get here  and find Mrs. F I should be *safe*. I found her and I lighted your gas, wound up your clock, drew your curtains and embraced your black overcoat before I sat down,  frightened no longer.  Do not be angry with me, Bogey.  Ca a ete plus fort que moi ….  That is why I am here. When you came to tea this afternoon you took a brioche, broke it in half and padded the inside doughy bit with two fingers.  You  always do that with a bun or roll or a piece of bread.  It is your way – your head a little on one side the while. When you opened your suitcase, I saw your old Feltie and a French book and a com all higgledy-piggedly.  ‘Tig, Ive only got 3  handkerchiefs.’ Why should that memory be so sweet to me?… Last night, there was a moment before you got into bed.  You stood, quite naked, bending forward a little, talking.  It was only for  an instant.  I saw you – I loved you so, loved your body with such tenderness.  Ah, my dear! And I am not thinking of *passion*.  No, of that other thing that makes me feel that every inch of you is so precious to me – your  soft shoulders – your creamy warm skin, your ears cold like shells are cold – your long legs and your feet that I love to clasp with my  feet – the feeling of your belly – and your thin young back.  Just below that bone that sticks out at the back of your neck you have a  little mole. It is partly because we are young that I feel this tenderness.  I love your mouth.  I could not bear that it should be touched even by  a cold wind if I were the Lord. We two, you know, have everything before us, and we shall do very great things.  I have perfect faith in us, and so perfect is my love  for you that I am, as it were, still, silent to my very soul. I want nobody but you for my lover and my friend and to nobody buy you shall I be faithful. I am yours forever. Tig.",1
"I just want to tell you how much I love you. You have brought so much happiness into my life and you do so much for me that no one has ever done for me before. I will continue to love you for the rest of my life, and forever.",1
"I can't explain the way I feel about you right now. I just love you so much it makes me want to cry. You say things to me that make me light up. Whenever I'm sick, you make me feel better. Whenever I'm tired, you let me sleep, even if you want to talk to me. Whenever I'm sad, you do whatever you can to make me feel better. When I'm mad, you leave me alone to let me cool down. Whenever you're around me, I usually just melt anyway! Whenever my day is bad and I see you, all my worries go away. You mean everything to me, and I hope you know that. I never felt this way about anyone else, and I hope you feel the same. I love you. Will you marry me?",1
"My business is located in your district and I have been one of your supporters throughout your term in office. I strongly encourage you to support House Bill 221, The Venture Capital Enhancement Act sponsored by Representative Davenport. Those of us in the high tech businesses understand how vital venture capital is to the growth of industry. Without it, we could not have enjoyed the advances in communication and medicine that we seen in the past decade. ",0
"Although we agreed earlier that I would pay overtime wages, if necessary, so that the carpeting could be completed by April 10, the situation has changed. The painting of the building's interior has been delayed, so the deadline for having the carpeting in place has been moved forward to April 24.This should help you to complete the project without incurring any overtime costs. I realize that such changes are never convenient, but trust that the extra time will, in the long run, benefit us all. Please let me know if there is any problem with this change; otherwise I will assume that this is acceptable to you. ",0
"Have you really not noticed, then, that here of all places, in this private, personal solitude that surrounds me, I have turned to you? All the memories of my youth speak to me as I walk, just as the sea shells crunch under my feet on the beach. The crash of every wave awakens far-distant reverberations within me. I hear the rumble of bygone days, and in my mind the whole endless series of old passions surges forward like the billows. I remember my spasms, my sorrows, gusts of desire that whistled like wind in the rigging, and vast vague longings that swirled in the dark like a flock of wild gulls in a storm cloud. On whom should I lean, if not on you? My weary mind turns for refreshment to the thought of you as a dusty traveler might sink onto a soft and grassy bank.",1
"I understand that my payment is three weeks late, but that does not justify your collections office's actions. During the past five days I have received three telephone calls and four letters. In addition, one of your representatives has contacted three of my relatives who have nothing to do with my finances. By anyone's definition this is harassment. I expect you to stop contacting me every day and to stop calling my relatives.In the meantime, please know that I plan to send you a payment within the next few days. The money will reach your office in about a week. ",0
"I don't know what a love letter should look like. I don't know the best words to use. What I do know, however, is that I love you more than anyone I have ever loved before.I knew I was falling for you the very first time we met. That moment was years ago, but the sensations I felt then and the realizations I had at the time are just as fresh for me today, because you've continued to nurture me with so much love. If there's anything special in me, if there's anything wonderful, it's because you brought it to life, and you helped me grow. You've truly helped me to become the person I am today. Nothing is more wonderful or unconditional than our love.Thank you for bringing love into my life. Thank you for loving me and for letting me love you. You are truly a blessing.",1
"I am thinking about you every second of every day and cannot wait until I see you again. We should never be apart this long again. I miss your kisses and your touch. I miss you so much. I hope that I can see you soon, but until I do, I will keep you in my dreams and in my heart. Remember that I love you, and that I always will. We are lucky because we found each other a second time, and we are able to love each other more than we ever had before. I am waiting to see you again. It's only been a little over a week, but now I know that I cannot be away from you for long. I love you with all my heart.",1
"I am writing to tell you how much you truly mean to me. This last year was the best year in my life, and it's all because of you. I love you with every beat of my heart. All my thoughts turn to you.

"I've kept my feelings for you contained as long as I can. I am in love with you, and true, honest love should not be contained and kept quiet forever. There is so much about you that most girls don't see. They only see the physical. They see your body, but my love for you is more than skin deep. My feelings for you grow every day, and my love grows deeper with every passing minute. You mean so much to me. Just seeing your smiling face or hearing you heart-melting voice brightens up my worst days and makes them more than just bearable. Just having a hug from you makes me feel warm and cozy inside. I dream of you day in and day out; you're the only one on my mind now. I am in love with you and have been in love with you since I can't remember when!",1
"You have been the best boyfriend in the world. Any girl would be happy to be in my shoes. You have taught me so much, even if you think you know little. You said when I came into your life, I changed you, but no one can change anyone--you're the only one with the power to change yourself.Thank you for all the material things--from Winnie the Pooh dolls to designer handbags. You shower me with gifts and get me anything I want in the world, but even though you have money now, it didn't buy my love. Love must come naturally, and it did. You bought me everything I ever wanted and more. The only thing left is an Escalade XLT, but hey, I guess that can wait, huh? Just joking!No matter what your decision is, please keep me in your thoughts and remember that I love you. Material things are nice, but love is best. You always told me that I was the finest girl you had ever seen, so get off work early, and let's kick back together for once. I love you.",1
"How are you doing now and today? Hope all is fine. Well, it has been a very long time since we've seen each other and I must let you know that the pain I'm having right now is more than what I can express to you in writing.It's time for us to put away our childish attitude because now I really know how much we are missing each other. Please, do come back to me; you still have a place in my heart, I am assuring you that I have been very lonely ever since you said goodbye.Remember those days when we both shared together the songs we sang together, how we played together, the smiles that come on us each time we see each other. Don't throw away all the sweet memories, which we have shared.My one and only, please come back to me. You still have a place in my heart. I know quite sure that you may feel I will not give you a chance based on the old stories. This is the only opportunity we have to rewrite our history. Never mind, just put away your pride because I'll accept any simplicity at any giving time.Come back, please come back and rewrite our history.It's me, your one and lonely,",1

"I am writing you this letter to tell you how much you mean to me, and to thank you for coming into my life. You are something I never thought could exist for me. You are the best thing that has ever happened in my life, and I don't regret telling you how I feel.I have been through many relationships, but didn't really take any of them seriously. I was used and abused by a guy who I really loved once. So I decided to play guys the same way that guys had played me. I wasn't born nasty; a guy made me this way. Since then I have not taken chances with a guy again. But you happened; you came into my life and stole my heart away from the day I met you.At first I was confused. I didn't really know what I wanted. I didn't know if I wanted to take a chance again and actually take you seriously. So, I decided to come close to you as a friend and find out who you truly were first and what you were really like. You seemed cool, nice, and funny--some things I really liked in a guy. So I took a chance and got together with you.In the beginning, things didn't seem to go very well. I actually had my doubts about you, and I wasn't sure you were actually taking me seriously. But it was too late to turn back. I had already fallen for you from the day I first met you, and I wasn't really looking forward to giving up so soon. I tried so hard to know you. I wasn't going to let you go so easily!Well, time has passed, and I have discovered new things about a new me. You have truly changed me. Still, I'm scared, because I'm growing a deep feeling inside my heart that I just can't explain. I truly don't know what your feelings are, but I don't want to force you to tell me something you don't really feel towards me. I want to receive love and trust from you when you truly mean it. All I ask of you is to show me that you care for me, and to also trust me the way I trust you.",1

We chatted as we played and quickly became interested in one another.I was skeptical at first because of the pain I had felt from knowing others, but you quickly made me forget all the doubts that I had.

I am anxious to see where our relationship can go now.The first time I heard you say the words, ""I love you,"" it was like a load had been taken off my shoulders.

But we accept those differences, embracing them because they have become part of the things we love about each other. Even in our bad moods and regardless of the irritations we find in daily life, we manage to make each other laugh. Our joking together may seem silly to other people, but it always makes us chuckle and laugh. The sound of your laughter warms my heart and is music to my ears. I believe we could survive anywhere and overcome anything as long as we were together!Love is not a job, love simply is. Unconditional love is what I offer you and, when I'm with you, I feel like I receive the same in return. You are my heart of hearts, my soul mate, my friend, my lover, and my partner for life. Thank you for being there, for loving me, and for giving me everything that my heart has ever wanted. I love you now and always will.",1

"The Almighty has chosen you to be my soulmate, as no one else can understand me better than you do. I love you, stay with me always.",1
"If there's one thing in this world I'm afraid to lose, it's you. I am so in love with you that I can't afford to lose you!",1
"You bid me write short to you and I have much to say. You also bade me believe that it was a fancy which made me cherish an attachment  for you. It cannot be a fancy since you have been for the last year the object upon which every solitary moment led me to muse. I do not expect you to love me, I am not worthy of your love. I feel you are superior, yet much to my surprise, more to my happiness, you betrayed passions I had believed no longer alive in your bosom. Shall I also have to ruefully experience the want of happiness? Shall I reject it when it is offered? I may appear to you imprudent, vicious; my opinions detestable, my theory depraved; but one thing, at least, time shall show you: that I love gently and with affection, that I am incapable of anything approaching to the feeling of revenge or malice; I do assure you, your future will shall be mine, and everything you shall do or say, I shall not question. Jane Clairmont",1
"You were kind enough to praise my presentation on Food Safety at the Public Health Conference in Springfield last June. I particularly appreciated the suggestions you made about the overhead slides I was using.After six years of working in public health education for the Springfield Health Department, I will be moving to Centerville some time within the next few months. I would like to find a similar position there. I particularly enjoy teaching and would like to continue working directly with the public, rather than in a laboratory.You are so much better acquainted with Centerville than I am, and I hope you would not mind letting me know if any suitable opportunities arise. My number is 555-5555. I would be happy to send you a copy of my resume to give you a better idea of my qualifications and experience. ",0
"Sweetheart, I am forever devoted to our relationship together. Each and every day I wonder how all of this came about. We were just living our lives when all of a sudden this happened--we fell helplessly in love with each other.I still remember the first day you entered my life. I knew right away that there was something special about you. What I didn't completely know yet was that you were the one who would turn my world inside out. I can't wait until we are able to spend each and every moment together. I can't live without you now.Thank you for making all my dreams come true. You have meant more to me than anyone ever has or ever will. I love you because you are the only person who can make me smile even when I am having a bad day. I love you because I've found someone who will love me more than anyone else could, no matter what. I love you because you will do anything to keep me safe without even thinking about it twice. I love you most of all because you are my one and only soul mate. We belong together, and I couldn't be any happier now. I love you with every breath that I take, and with every beat of my heart.",1
"We create a harmony together that people rarely experience in this life. Like bow on a string, we complement and enhance each other perfectly. We bring out the beauty and resonance in each other. As a couple, it's clear that our love is meant to be.We have both been through so many heartaches before, and I know that we have learned too much through this life to ever take each other for granted. I know that we will never grow tired of exploring with each other or of learning new things together. I know that our life together will always be an exhilarating journey and a mesmerizing constellation of all that is good.I am so thankful to be with you. I want you to feel the unwavering love I have for you, so that I can make you ecstatically happy. I don't want you to doubt for a moment that you are everything I need and want. I cannot remember any time when I have wanted anyone or anything more. You consume me. There are simply no words to adequately describe the depth of my feelings for you. I love you in every way.",1
"Before I met you, I was resigned to the fact that love was a part of my past, nothing more than a mere, painful memory. Then you came into my life and a miracle happened. You opened my heart in ways it had never been opened before and that awakened a part of me that had lain dormant all my life. Although I had loved and been loved before, never had it been so intense and as deep as what I learned to feel for you. I had never before experienced the true joy of complete empowering, soul-felt love as we share now. ""I love you""--those three simple words I say out loud whenever I think of you bring a smile to my face and a song to my heart.I feel comfort in knowing that we can disagree and get through the roughest times, realizing that we can't live without each other. I am as secure in knowing I have your love as you are in knowing you have mine. What more could we ask for than to have found the one true love that each of us had been searching for all our lives? I love you!",1
"I don't think I have ever told you before how I felt the first time we met. You were so cute, and your deep blue eyes were so charismatic, I felt like I would lose myself in them.I never use to believe in love at first sight, but that day when our eyes met, my heart pounded and it felt like it would burst. It was like the feeling of a home run, like making it across the finish line for the first time. I was swept off my feet! And when you winked at me, I felt like I couldn't breathe; you kissed me, and my knees suddenly went weak. I fell in love at that moment. I knew then what love at first sight felt like; our eyes met, and there was a connection, like a bond I felt uniting our hearts. I have been in love since that day and still am, though you're far away and we've gone our separate ways. You will always be my first and greatest love. You will always live in my heart for all eternity.",1
"Many things have happened in the past, and so many things have changed. It doesn't matter how much time has gone by. Time could never weaken my feelings for you or make them fade away. Now we are back together to give us one more chance. Love, trust, understanding, affection, honesty, tolerance, and loyalty are all key factors for a successful relationship. Every time I think of you, my heart misses a beat. You're my theme for a dream! Every moment we share together, we grow closer. I'm waiting to see you again. I need you to hold me so tight that you fill my world with love.",1

"I know we don't get to talk or see each other any more, but being apart for now doesn't change the way I feel about you. Sure I'm lonely, and sometimes I'm overwhelmed with this emptiness in my heart. Just remember that I love you and everything about you. That's what gets me through every minute of every day that I'm without you. Sweetheart, you don't know what I would give to kiss your lips, feel your touch, or even just to be you. I long to hold you and feel your sweet caress. I have never loved anyone as much as I love you.You make me feel loved, you make me feel safe but, more importantly, you make me feel wanted. We both knew our friendship would grow from the first day we spoke. But neither one of us could begin to imagine the love we would both feel now, not dramatically exploding or thundering in our hearts, but slowly growing into a beautiful relationship that only you and I could understand. You are my soul mate, my best friend, my inspiration, and my true love.I don't care if you forget our first kiss or our first date, just as long as you remember that I love you with every aching bone in my body and always will, no matter what. Having your love has been the best thing that has ever happened to me. I don't care what others say about you and me. All I know is that I love you and that will never change.",1
"Every time I think of you, half my worries are gone. You make everything around you so positive and energetic. I love you so much.",1
"Wow, I don't even know where to start. I don't know if you even think about me but you make my heart pound so fast that it's hard to catch my breath. When I think of us getting together, I get goose bumps all over. You're all I think about now. I've never had a love like this before or felt this way. I want to keep you forever.",1
"It's been so long since I've been in your arms, felt your touch, or looked into your eyes. The worst part about it all is that I only have myself to blame for it all. I'd give anything for just one last chance to be with you. I thought I was over you, but who am I kidding, I'm not. Please tell me what it would take to be close to you again, I'd do whatever you ask me to. I miss you.",1
"I love you more than words could ever express. From the first moment I saw you, I wanted to get to know you. Although I was only a teenager at the time, you taught me how to express myself as a mature adult. You taught me everything I know about loving someone with true depth of feeling. You molded our love into something rare and beautiful. Now that eight years have passed, our love continues to grow. Everyone looks at our relationship with jealousy because we are the epitome of pure love, and not just physical attraction. Whenever you touch me, I tingle all over and that is why I love you.",1
"I am both surprised and excited that your organization selected me to serve as an honorary board member for your project. Because I have long had an interest in your cause, I am eager to lend my support.

However, to show my support I would enjoy reviewing your literature and offering some suggestions.I hope you will meet with every success in your praiseworthy endeavors. Your efforts will benefit many. ",0
"Here's to a man I thought I'd never know! The one who stole my heart so innocently, but with care and grace, and perfect love. My perfect thought is just being together forever. The sweetest word I say is your name. And the greatest thing to imagine is your love. Every silent prayer that has left my mind, all the empty words that have chased my lips and left my mouth, and all the lonely tears that have escaped my eyes have made me who I am, one who just loves you more.All the guys who just wanted my body, all the pieces of myself I've given away, all the things I had wished I had done, and all the things I wished I hadn't done just helps me love you with purity and certainty. Those times we start to fight makes me feel like we're gambling our very souls. I hope we never lose. I love you so much; those five words can't have any more meaning than anything else I say ever possibly could. I love you with all that I am--all my achievements as well as all my faults. I love you for all that you are, too. I hope in the quiet of the night when I call out your name, you will know it and hear my voice whispering how much I love you.",1
"Every day I think about you. I miss you so much. I know too many things have happened for us to even try to work things out again. Too many nasty words were said between us. I know you will always be my best friend, and I will always love you and keep you in my heart.I think that with every day that goes by without you, you will become easier to forget, but you're not. It's actually harder every day to get over you and the kind of love that you and I shared. I know you still love me, and I still love you, but I don't think things will ever again be like they used to be.You are everything to me, and I know I was the one responsible for everything that has gone wrong between us, and for that I am forever sorry! Please forgive me for everything that I have done to you and to our relationship.I love you now and will continue to love you as time goes by.",1

If I can be of help, please don't hesitate to call me. My desk telephone is 555-5555. ",0
"Thank you for your kindness and good humor when stitching me up in the middle of the night last Saturday. I had heard nightmare stories about what goes on in emergency rooms, so I was grateful that my experience was so positive. I did not have to wait long, and the treatment I received was very sensitive and kind. I send my heartfelt thanks to you and the nurses who assisted. ",0
"I wish I could go back in time to our relationship, back before hurt found its way into our hearts. If only I could slip back into those moments, I would have been more honest with myself and more attentive to what my heart was telling me. I would have held you a little longer and never, ever hurt you, but time will not allow me to go back and change any of my mistakes.I can't take away the questions that flood you, but I can try to answer them. I can't erase the pain that fills your heart, but I can try to ease it. I know that I can't just jump back into your life and expect everything to remain the same, nor can I expect you to still have the same feelings for me. A lot of time has passed, and just because I feel as though I am ready to have you in my life again, it may now be different for you. I know I can't have things fall into place whenever I am ready for them; destiny has no patience and holds back for no one. I might have lost my chances with you because of my ignorance and my fear of falling in love, but I can't ignore this gut feeling in my heart like I once did before.I want us to work things out, and though it might not be possible, if you're willing, I want to try. I am no longer frightened as I was before, and when I was with you, I should have realized from the beginning that I never had any reason to worry about anything.I miss you. If for whatever reason, things don't work out between us, or if you choose to remain just a friend, that's perfectly fine. I will take it as fate passed me by and that we just weren't meant to be together. Whatever the outcome might be, please know that I am still so grateful to once have had you a part of my life.",1
"All I wanted from the start was to be with you. God knows how much you mean to me, not only as a friend, but with deeper, greater feelings as well.As you know me by now, this is a way for me to pour out my heart to you, to let you know it's dying because you're gone.You brought back the light into my life when all I could see was darkness. You brought back the smile to my face when all I could do was frown. Most importantly, though, you brought back the love and trust that I had lost for people. We shared plenty of moments where we opened up to each other and shared our secrets, our feelings of happiness, sadness, sometimes anger and intimacy. We promised each other that, no matter what, we would always be together because fate had decided we would be. But now you have decided that it's not what you want any more.How can this be? Why now? Why now when my heart fully belongs to you? Why now when I have fallen in love with you? Why now when I was ready to be with you for the rest of my life? I find fate can turn out so cruel and twisted; it's always getting my hopes up, just to bring them back down again. Each time the pain comes back, it's stronger and longer.Why did you do this to me, when you knew I would have done anything for you? When you knew that all my hopes and dreams surrounded you? When you knew that not having you in my life would cause me so much pain? But I know I can't change your mind and, more importantly, I can't change what you feel in your heart, so all I can do is ask you, why?I miss you every moment.",1
You turned my life into a journey of love and happiness. Every second I spend with you; I fall in love even more with you!,1
"While I lay here waiting to hear from you, I can't help but think how my life changed when you became a part of it. All that I envision for us being together has been the focus of my thoughts every day, knowing that one day everything will finally happen.You give me reason to wake up in the morning and smile. Just smile for no particular reason, except for the fact that you are coming here. As the days go by, I feel myself growing closer and closer to you, and my heart is slowly coming out of its shy corner and feeling what it feels like to be loved again. I don't ever want to lose this feeling. I don't ever want to lose you.When I hear your voice, it gives me comfort and joy. Those are feelings I don't want to let go of. The sound of your voice is like my favorite love song. I can listen to it all evening until it puts me to sleep. Still as I continue to lay here and think about everything you are to me, I can't help but wonder, what's on your mind, too? How much do you feel, and how real do you think our love actually is?I just want you to know that wherever this road may take us, and how far it may be to finally get where we want to go, you are in my heart, and in my heart is where you'll always be. Life wasn't this kind to me until there was you. Thank you for being you. What I'd like to say next, I wish I could say to you in person.You have all my love.",1
"Although we've never met, I feel as if I know you well. I knew from the start that there was something special about you; you touched my heart and haven't let go of it. Our relationship has given me a lot of dreams, and now I feel hope. You entered my thoughts and magically erased all of my fears with your sweet and caring ways. Now I look forward to each day and feel so much at ease with you. I'm so grateful that we're able to share our problems and aspirations with each other. It truly seems as if you're a part of me now, as if our time together was a union of souls. The thought of you fills me with smiles, and I can't wait to hug you each day.",1
"Though the miles separate us, the bond we have is far stronger. You are the very one I have spent all these years looking for. You make me smile. You make me laugh. You make me whole. I cannot describe the giddy feeling I have when you are near or even when you just cross my mind. I am so amazingly happy and content when I'm with you, I want to spend forever in your life, in your world, in your family, and in your arms.",1

"Hey, you! Well, right now I'm about to go to sleep but, before I do, I've decided to end this wonderful day with a little note I wrote for you. Baby, I've got to say, your love has brought me happiness from the day you asked, ""Would you be my girl?""Isn't it amazing how two strangers with two separate worlds meet and fall in love? I never thought I would wake up and realize how beautiful you are to me. You showed me the right from the wrong; you gave me strength to believe in love. You were the one who taught me how to be myself and to be strong. Baby, I have so much faith in you that I never thought I would say this: you're the love of my life, the one I choose to marry.

I hardly understand what I feel for you, and don't know how these long, sleepless nights, thinking only of you can go one. I've never felt like this before. I don't know how to pour out my feelings for you now. I wanted to find the perfect words to make you realize how much I need you and love you, but words continue to elude me; what could they be? Something poetic? I'm sure it should be heartfelt and out of the ordinary. I'm afraid it's no use. Every time I look at you, the words come out the same--I love you!",1
"I plowed the vast ocean on a frail bit of timber; (whereas) the ship that bore the son of AEson (Jason)* was strong…  The furtive arts of Cupid aided him; arts which I wish that Love had not learned from me. He returned home; I shall die in  these lands, if the heavy wrath of the offended God shall be lasting. My burden, most faithful wife, is a harder one than that which the son of AEson bore. You, too, whom I left still young at  my departure from the City, I can believe to have grown old under my calamities. Oh, grant it, ye Gods, that I may be enabled  to see you, even if such, and to give the joyous kiss on each cheek in its turn; and to embrace your emaciated body in my arms,  and to say, “’twas anxiety, on my account, that caused this thinness”; and, weeping, to recount in person my sorrows to you in  tears, and thus enjoy a conversation that I had never hoped for; and to offer the due frankincense, with grateful hand, to the  Caesars, and to the wife that is worthy of a Caesar, Deities in real truth! Oh, that the mother of Menon, that Prince being softened, would with her rosy lips, speedily call forth that day.",1
"A girl like you deserves all the happiness in the world. You are so precious to me, and I'll protect you from every harm. Every time I see the smile on your face, it feels like heaven to me. You are the most beautiful part of my life, and I'll keep you happy always, I promise.",1
"I am pleased to nominate Jane Doe for the Employee of the Year Award. I have known and worked with Jane for ten years and have always found her dependable, efficient, and unfailingly punctual. In fact, I have never worked with a person who gives as much attention to detail as she does. Also, her willingness to take on difficult projects like the Doe proposals and see them to successful completion has repeatedly impressed me over the years.Her skills do not end with her office work. She also projects a warm, cheerful attitude to our clients. I have seen her resolve conflicts and handle other difficult situations with remarkable patience and admirable tact. In the community she goes out of her way to help people in need by organizing charity drives each December and singing with the city choir. She loves people, works hard, and always tries to lift the spirits of those around her. I believe these characteristics represent all that is good in our company, and I am pleased to nominate her for the honor of Employee of the Year. ",0
"Much as I would like to take some of the credit for the next great decision in your life, I must bow out. Advising you on your relationship with Jane Doe would put me into a conflict of interest that could come back and haunt me.I wish you the very best of luck and wisdom in this tricky situation. ",0
"My name is Jane Doe, policy number 55555. This month's summary of my various insurance policies indicates that I only carry $150,000 of life insurance. This is not so. Every summary prior to this one and my policy itself indicates that I carry $450,000 of life insurance. Certainly I pay the premiums for the higher amount. Perhaps this is simply a typographical error? Please correct my summary as soon as possible. ",0
"You were and still are the great love of my life. I know that phrase is often used but it fits this situation. I made so many mistakes when we were together and, as a result of them, we're not together anymore. I've spent the time since then kicking myself for the things that I did, and for the things that I didn't do. All I can do now is say I love you, I love you, I love you.A million times I'm sorry and a million times I love you. Sorry that I couldn't say those words to you when it would have made a difference. Sorry that I didn't give you the innermost parts of me that you expected. I want you to be happy with me. Please forgive me.",1

"I love you so much, and I miss you. I miss the little things you did like calling me ""Boo Bear"" or ""Baby."" I miss holding you, kissing you; I miss everything about you. You just don't know what you do to me; every time I hold you I feel complete. Every time I kiss you I feel bliss, every time I talk to you, it makes my day. But not knowing if I'll ever hold you, look into your eyes, or kiss you again scares me so much.My heart aches at the thought of not being with you. I cherish the time we spent together--every hug, every kiss, the walks, the talks, just holding hands. I cherish you, I love you, and I'm so glad I found you. I would give anything just for you to be in my arms again; without you I feel so empty. When I'm with you, there is just this feeling that makes my heart beat faster I just feel so good, like I can fly. It's like all the love I feel for you flows through my entire body.When I hold you, I feel so complete. That's why I love holding you. I want to hold you and tell you everything's going to be okay. I want to comfort you. I know you have been hurt before and so have I, so I never want to hurt you. I want to hold you and make the bad feelings go away, yours and mine. I want to hold you and make you feel safe, protected, supported, and loved. When I hold you, it's like nothing else matters except you and me. I want to take you to a place where time stops and there's nothing to worry about except you and me. I want to talk more about you and the troubles you're going through, so I can help you even more. I want to be with you so you can put your mind at ease and not stress about anything anymore.We have all the time in the world to talk or do whatever. I wish I could take you somewhere where we could relax and be free and forget about all our troubles. I want to treat you like a queen, the way you should always be treated. You are my queen. How can I tell you that you mean more to me than life itself? I love you more than life. With each passing day I love you more and more. Just loving you has its rewards. I never want to fight or argue with you; I just want to love you.I just wish you were here right now so I could tell you this. I just keep trying to figure out all the wrongs I've done to you. Maybe I didn't say I loved you enough, maybe I didn't talk enough or open up. Maybe I didn't understand you enough. I just keep coming up with more things that I think I've done wrong to you. If I could, I would go back in time and redo all the wrongs I have done to you and make them right. I just hope you find it in your heart to forgive me for all the things I've done to you and take me back. I should have done a lot of things better that I will do better now.Every time I'm away from you, I feel so empty. I think that's why I pressured you to be with me when you didn't have any free time. All those miles away from when I was in college. I felt so empty inside, wanting to call you and talk, but I couldn't because I had no money for a phone card. I wanted to be with you so much it hurt, and then when I saw other couples on campus holding hands, I felt even worse. You know what I mean. Each minute away from you felt like an eternity. I love you so much.I hurt when you hurt; when you're sad, I feel it. When you're depressed, I'm depressed. I love you so much. I don't like it when you're sad. I want you to be happy like you have made me. I'm so glad I found you. I would do anything to see you smile. I wish I could take away all the troubles in your life. But all I can do is comfort you and be here if you need me. I love you and wish I could do more for you. I want to help you and make you happy.Love is not just saying, 'I love you,"" to that special person; it's so much more than that. It's helping, supporting, being there for them, standing by their side no matter what happens and doing anything you can for them. Love means forgiving and forgetting whatever mistakes they make and accepting them the way they are. I wish I could hold you and comfort you right now. I can only hope the things I do, say, and write bring you happiness like you have given me. You are my heart and soul. If I can do anything more for you, let me know, and I will do it..You mean so much to me and I'm lucky to have you. I try to keep everything you send me; remember when you sent me that email that talked about Valentine's Day? I have a copy of it in my wallet for inspiration or when I feel down I read it. I've had it ever since you sent it to me. I love you so (x a million) much, I cherish the ground you walk on, I cherish everything about you, and I cherish you. You mean everything to me, you are special to me and you make me so happy and I feel so free when I'm around you. You're always on my mind. I think of you everyday, sometimes when I see something on TV or hear a song, I think of you.I love you and think about you all the time and I worry about you. I always wonder how you feel, how you're doing, what you're doing. Because I know you get depressed and sad and I worry about that. I want to try and help you because I've been there and done that. I've been depressed and I know how it feels, that's why I want to help. I love you and I don't want you to have to go through that alone, you may think you have to go at that alone but that's not true. I'm here to help you, I want to support you and I worry about that. I love you so much and I don't want you to worry or be depressed or be stressed out about something. I want to help you and comfort you; I want to try to make you as happy as you make me. You mean the world to me and I love you so much. All I want to do is hold you and love you and make all your troubles go away, I wish I could have told you this earlier.I just want to make you happy, so happy that you would feel as though you could fly. Babe, let's try to piece our relationship back together. I need you--my heart needs you and I feel so empty without you. I love you so much.",1
"I get sad when I look back on our time together. I withdraw into those moments we had that were so consumed with passion and so full of promise. If I could go back and relive each of those precious moments with you, I would certainly do it even if I knew the pain I would face when the time came to walk away.My feelings for you were feelings of love, unlike anything I have ever known. I wonder if I will feel that strongly again. I've also had to accept the fact that what I felt was one-sided. I loved you and I have no regrets about that. You were always very honest with me. Never once did you lead me on. You always made me face reality and deal with life. How do I say ""thank you"" for something like that? I know we were never actually together, but the memories I have of you are treasures.",1
"Words can't begin to explain how much you meant to me. You were by my side through thick and thin. You taught me how to see the world through someone else's eyes. You helped me discover who I really was, and who I want to be. You filled my heart with so much joy, but then something went wrong. You took it all away in the blink of an eye. It was only when you started to fade away that I began to see who you really were.Now I think of all the memories we've shared, and I want to thank you. Thanks for all the good advice you gave me, like: ""Reach for the highest star. Follow your dreams and you'll get what you want. Don't let the scoffers bring you down."" Thank you so much! You left emptiness in my heart when you walked out the door, but I still wish you all the best.",1

"Baby, the first time I talked to you, I knew you were my soul mate. I didn't even know what you looked like, but by the time I came to visit you, I was already in love with you. You stole my heart just by talking to me on the phone first. My first reaction was that I was crazy for doing what I was doing.The past few months have been really hard for us, not knowing what direction our lives were going. I knew in the end that if it was going to be a joint life for us, it would work out, and so far things are looking up. You are my hero, and I love you with all my heart and soul now. You mean the world to me. The two weeks we had to spend apart were really hard on me, but I'm glad you're home with me now.I love to be loved by you. You make me feel as no other man has ever made me feel. I feel safe with you, and I have finally found peace and comfort. Thanks be to you and only to you. I will do anything in the world for you and you know that. My life without you would be pointless, and I don't ever want to lose you. Your love, strength, and encouragement are what keep me going now. I often wonder what I did to make a man like you love me so much. Baby, I will always love you, and I will always be here for you no matter what.",1

"Because I know you do a great deal to help the members of my section, I feel I can turn to you with a matter that has caused us much personal frustration and even more wasted time. For several weeks now, the Vice President's secretary has been sending people to do his copying on our machine. We want to cooperate, but sometimes they occupy the machine for two or three hours, making our own people wait. At this rate we are falling behind in our own work, and our production figures are suffering.Would it be possible for the Company to buy another copy machine, either for our use, or for the vice president's projects? I suppose his secretary could send people to other offices, but it would simply mean transferring the problem to someone else. I think another machine would be the best solution for all concerned.I know my staff would sincerely appreciate being able to use their time more efficiently. I look forward to your response so I can tell them what to expect. ",0

The hour of my death draweth fast on, and my case being such, the tender love I owe you forceth me, with a few words, to put you in remembrance of the health and safeguard of your soul, which you ought to prefer before all worldly matters, and before the care and tendering of your own body, for the which you have cast me into many miseries and yourself into many cares.

For the rest I commend unto you Mary, our daughter, beseeching you to be a good father unto her, as I heretofore desired.

Before we ship any toaster, we double-check every function, so your problem may be one you can solve quite easily.When the bread does not go down, you can usually correct the problem by rotating the screw on the bottom of the toaster a turn or two to the right.

Your Doe toaster should give you many years of trouble-free service. ",0
"I am writing to draw your attention to a matter of great importance. Mayor Doe has pledged to address the dangerous condition of many of the intersections surrounding our children's schools. However, due to last year's extensive flooding, city coffers are nearly empty, and the funds are not available to install even one new traffic light. The intersection of Main and Center streets is fraught with danger for the dozens of grade school children who must cross these streets every day. If we can raise $3,600 we can pay an off-duty policeman to direct traffic at this crosswalk during school hours until such time as funds are available to install a proper traffic light.

"There were times before when I thought I had found true love, a love so intense and real that I would forever be caught in its spell forever. Then the time would come when I realized I was mistaken. I spent the most agonizing days of my life after my great love ended with sleepless nights and my pillow always wet with tears. I always thought I was losing my mind and mourn for what turned out to be just a short-lived love.And then I met you, a new friend. No sooner did we meet than I found out you had suffered the same anguish as I had just a month ago. I found it comforting to talk to you about the pain and misery of losing a love I thought would last. Somehow we never felt embarrassed talking to each other about our heartaches. It seemed to bring each of us some relief.Even though we still have the reassuring friendship we started out with, I'm happy it has grown into so much more. You turned out to be my best friend and companion. You saved me from misery and loneliness. I wasn't yearning anymore for my old love to come back, nor desperately seeking a new love. I was content just to spend time with you. I love your company, your intelligence, and your wonderful sense of humor. I love the way you make me look forward to waking up again in the morning, and the way you make me go to sleep with a smile on my face. More than anything else, I love you for just being you.

It is a time to reminisce, and we have been doing a lot of it lately. We laugh when we think of the time John ate that big potato and when Jane decorated the kitchen with mistletoe. Our hearts fill with gratitude when we think of how you helped Eric during his illness. Those were wonderful times.This year we have enjoyed watching Eric learn to walk. Fred turned six and entered first grade. Jane surprised us by resigning from Doe Corporation to go back to school. John continues to teach, but finds time to swim, read, and play with the kids. We hope you are all in good health. We wish you the best that this holiday season can offer. ",0

Because we are just friends, really good friends, and you don't want to ruin that, but then you kissed me!You said that it meant nothing, and that you have too much respect for our friendship.

I want you to take a risk and learn that being together can be great!I know that things could never be the same again, but that's what life is all about--taking risks!

We need to jump onto a good thing and let our feelings fly.I love you, and if you have not seen that by now, then you are blind. I used to think it was just your looks, but then I realized it's who you are inside that makes my heart beat at this pace. Just being around you makes my life worth living.

For you I would give anything and you know I would. I love everything about you, and I hurt when we are apart. I know I have a hard time expressing how I feel about you. Some might say I'm too young to know what love is, but to me age has no place in deciding love. When I realized that, I realized that I loved you with all my heart.

Without you, I am incomplete; there is a great void in me. I dare not imagine life without you because the mere thought terrifies me.You are my world, my life, and my love--always. You didn't just steal my heart; you are my heart, my soul, my friend.There have been so many mistakes made, so many wrongs that cannot be undone.

You showed me that I deserved to be loved and to be happy. You gave new meaning to my life, and I can never thank you enough for that!

I've longed to be with you for years, but never really had the guts to do anything about it. That was until you actually approached me and from then on, I have been in love--not a crush, not puppy love, but true, honest-to-goodness love. The kind of love that somehow transforms you from one of those people who think that everyone else gets everything, to one of those people who is convinced they actually have it all.Honey, I guess what I'm trying to say is that before you, it seemed that I had nothing, and now I feel I have everything. It is all due to you and you alone. Well, I should probably tell you now that I love you and miss you and that this has got to be harder than anything I have ever done--feeling so close to you, yet being so far away.This is really hard for me because what I want to say is--pray for me and that this war will be over soon, so we can have peace, and so I can come home to you.",1

"My Darling Josephine: Am nearly through with my writing. Am brain weary with the thousand and one imperative details and things  to think of. Everything thus far has gone well, too well I am afraid, and I am (solely on general principles) somewhat suspicious  of the future. The ship is in better shape than before; the party and crew are apparently harmonious; I have 21 Eskimo men  (against 23 last time) but the total of men women and children is only 50 as against 67 before owing to a more careful selection  as to children… I have landed supplies here, and leave two men ostensibly on behalf of Cook. As a matter of fact I have established here the sub-base which last I established at Victoria Head, as a precaution in event of  loss of the Roosevelt either going up this fall or coming down next summer. In some respects this is an advantage as on leaving  here there is nothing to delay me or keep me from taking either side of the Channel going up. the conditions give me entire control  of the situation… You have been with me constantly, sweetheart. At Kangerdlooksoah I looked repeatedly at Ptarmigan Island and thought of the time we  camped there. At Nuuatoksoah I landed where we were. And on the 11th we passed the mouth of Bowdoin Bay in brilliant weather, and as  long as I could I kept my eyes on Anniversary Lodge. We have been great chums dear. Tell Marie to remember what I told her, tell  “Mister Man” [Robert Peary, Jr.] to remember “straight and strong and clean and honest”, obey orders, and never forget that Daddy  put “Mut” in his charge till he himself comes back to take her. In fancy I kiss your dear eyes and lips and cheeks sweetheart; and  dream of you and my children, and my home till I come again. Kiss my babies for me. Aufwiedersehen. Love, Love, Love.  Your Bert",1

I think you expect everything from me now, but you don't really appreciate it.The conversations we've had about our friendship and where it's at and where it's going are so confusing to me. At one point, you told me how important I was to you. Then you tell me that you don't see how you could ever love me. The truth is that I never asked you to love me. I'm content loving you and just having you there as my friend. I hate the thought of not having you around anymore.Maybe someday you'll appreciate me but right now I have to concentrate on me and hope that someday I will find someone to love me for a change.",1

To even say, ""I do""--it's a scary thought, but you came along, and I suddenly became fearless.It's hard to explain myself or to put it together in one idea; the only easy course is my loving you. For just one look into your eyes makes everything in the world and in my life seem to glow. You make me want to see the sunrise every day, to know it's another day where I could have you by my side. I know faith can make this work someday if I just keep my hopes up. Until then I'll think of you just like now. Your touch will forever caress me with tenderness, and your kisses will keep the flame in my heart alive. I hope that one day soon you and I will be together again.",1

No man had ever captured my attention so fully or made my heart skip a beat the way it did that chilly February night.

I had no doubt you were the man God made especially for me.I want to thank you for that late night talk in the rain. You might have thought it was crazy then, but now you know it has ensured our future with an everlasting memory. Thank you for the conversation on the recliner in the sunroom and for asking me to be yours that night. Most importantly, thank you for falling in love with me and making me your wife. No matter how quickly our courtship passed, I know that standing before God and family and vowing to be your partner for life was the easiest decision I ever made.After only ten days as man and wife, we suddenly found ourselves divided by thousands of miles of sand and sea--separated by your service to our great nation and a war that could not wait. We've been apart for over seven months now. Each day that passes me by only makes my love for you grow stronger. Though we may struggle through our separation, please remember my love for you knows no boundaries and will continue to stretch across any ocean and over every grain of sand between us to get to you.I may be your wife, but you are my life.

No words can express my love for you because you are indescribable, and my love for you is immeasurable.Simply looking into your eyes sends me through a whirlwind of intense emotions. Just one brief smile from you fills my life with radiance and joy. Until the day I met you, I had never before felt so full of hope and passion. I want you to know, I am forever grateful to be with you. You have given me a heart full of love and days full of laughter, and I will give myself to you always.",1
"My love, you're the one I always want to be with. I want you to know I care about you deeply and hope you accept the way I feel about you. Things were a bit rough for me, but I feel happy now. I don't know what might have caused me to lose track, but all I'm saying is that I love you, and I want us to be together.",1
"In the last several years there has been a tremendous increase in the number of homeless citizens sleeping in Doe Park. On any given night I can count at least ten individuals quietly sleeping under trees and on benches. The problem is that the park restrooms close at dusk, and the homeless have no toilet facilities. On behalf of the over 200 neighborhood residents who have signed it, I present you with this petition requesting the city to install and maintain a sanitary, temporary toilet. This measure, while not solving the problem of the homeless, will help address the sanitation problem this neighborhood park faces. I am sure you will see the logic in this request and will implement this measure until the greater problem of homelessness in Springfield can be fairly and properly resolved. ",0
"Our love started over the Internet and everything seemed almost perfect then. We had never met, but the love we felt was so big and true, even then, and could only become complete by meeting each other.The very first day I saw you in person, we said, ""hello,"" immediately felt the thrill of that love and held one another so tightly. We didn't want to let go, and time stood still. We had a perfect day, and we knew it could only get better and better if we held, kissed, and hugged one another. After that moment, we never went through a day without saying how much we loved and needed each other and would for the rest of our lives.Being far away from you is difficult. Not sharing every day with you and not being able to hold you whenever I want hurts so much, but I know that at the end of all this pain, I will find you again. You stood by my side when things were good, and when they were bad, you listened and hugged me saying, ""Everything's gonna be okay."" And it was.I know we'll have a great life together, and I can't wait for us to be with each other every day now, sharing everyday problems and joy, without having to leave one another's side. Fate is putting us through this, but we'll come out of it all shining, as the love we feel for each other is hard to find.I'm proud of the person you are. I love the way you treat me and everyone else. I'm proud to be with someone like you, the sweetest and most caring guy I've ever known. Don't ever change, Honey, as you're perfect--we're perfect for each other and it will be like this for the rest of our lives.",1
"With much reluctance I wish to inform you of my resignation as Personnel Director, effective as soon as arrangements can be made to hire a new director. Last week, while inquiring about changes in my productivity, we discussed the fact that despite adequate sleep and nutrition I had been feeling unusually tired. We concluded that a visit to the doctor was in order. Since then, my doctor has informed me that I have Chronic Fatigue Immune Deficiency Syndrome (CFIDS). Unfortunately, the erratic hours and the fast pace of our work environment worsen the effects of my illness. For these reasons, my doctor has advised a cessation of all work activity and full bed rest for an indefinite amount of time.I am distressed that poor health dictates that I must quit my job. I searched a long time to find the kind of job that not only encourages the use of my creativity and is intellectually stimulating, but also affords an opportunity to meet with a variety of people on a daily basis. I appreciate the opportunity I have had to work here and sincerely hope that I may return when I regain my health.Because my current major projects have been completed, now is the best time for my departure. Except for a few minor tasks, there is nothing that demands my immediate attention. However, if problems should arise, please contact me at home and I will gladly assist you in any way I can. ",0

"We immediately connected in a way that lifted us above all else. It was so passionate, yet so spiritually uplifting--that's what ""making love"" is all about. It's spiritual, yet passionate at the same time. That intellectual, genuine, true appreciation for one another that we've had since we first met was the purest form of affection I have ever experienced. Now it's gone, at least for now.I have always been a very strong person but, as you can plainly see, I am hopelessly lost, like a little child that's been alone too long. On occasion, though, I can hear you in the house and, for a moment, like the poet said, ""All's right with the world."" I haven't thanked you lately for shining that light on my life.Your ghost keeps me company for a few seconds every once in a while. I wake up in the morning, and hear you in the kitchen, or in the shower, or I can smell your perfume, but it's just the ghost again. But I thank God every time I feel it, because when I am apart from my one and only soul mate, I learn to appreciate the little things we shared, even more than before.I believe that neither one of us really knew what true love could be until we met, nor what real passion was before we made love for the first time. We will make it through this now; we just have to trust one another enough not to be afraid of how overwhelming our challenges can be.You are my sunrise and sunset, every single day. You are my heart and soul--never have I met anyone with your kind spirit and loving heart. I am truly sorry if I have ever let an opportunity slip by without letting you know how special you were.I will love you always.",1

"We want you to be among the first to know that Jane gave birth to our sweet Tiffany Anne yesterday morning at 4:35. She weighed 7 pounds, 9 ounces, and measured 20 inches in length. She has lots of dark hair and long fingers like her mother. I think we have another pianist.We are still a little overwhelmed by the thought that we are parents, but the 3:00 a.m. feeding is beginning to make believers of us. We feel like a real family now. It has been an incredible experience that we wouldn't trade for anything. We hope we'll have a chance to show her off soon when we come to Springfield. ",0
"While visiting a library behind the former Iron Curtain, my wife and I were astonished that we could not find a single book in English. The librarian apologized and explained that his institution owned only four books in English, and this sparse collection was in great demand, with waiting lists sometimes twenty to thirty names long!It's easy to forget that books are prohibitively expensive in economically struggling countries. The door to economic prosperity remains closed for many, and knowledge of English, as the language of world trade and information exchange, may be the key to that door.Next week our diocese will collect books for the country of Moldavia. Your donation of new or used books in English on virtually any subject will open the door of opportunity for countless eager learners. Those of you who cannot donate books or help in the collection can still make a difference by sending your monetary donation in the envelope provided. Proceeds will cover our shipping costs, with any surplus applied to the purchase of used books.It's not enough to remember the less fortunate in thought alone. Let's remember them by our deeds! ",0

Of course, like all couples, we have had some rough times, some disagreements and obstacles, but the good has far outweighed the bad, and even the hard times have brought us closer together.Of course, it's possible that something could separate us and that we may not always be able to stay together. However, I want you to know that I shall always remember you as the partner who taught me the true meaning of life. I will always remember you with gratitude and deep affection. You mean so much to me now and will forever.",1
"Hi, how are you? Things on my end are going--well, let's just say that I am alive. I have never been the type to express exactly how I feel, but there are a few things that I would like to tell you. Every morning I wake up and there is a pain that shoots through my heart. The thought that I have to spend another day without you rips my soul apart.I know we thought it would be better for us both if we ended it, but the time I have spent away from you has taught me that I am inseparably a part of you, and you are a part of me, and that the best place for both of us is with each other. It pains me to know that you wake up with another woman beside you. It pains me to know that I could have let the best thing that ever happened to me leave without a fight. What hurts the most is the thought that you might not feel the same. I can't see my future any other way, except with you in it. It scares me to think, though, that you can so easily envision your future without me in it.",1

"Ever since we started talking, it has been like a dream no one else dreamed before. To know that you were affectionate towards me is almost indescribable. At first I could not believe it, because back then the very image of you and me together was always kept in the secret vault of my mind. Every night, the dream would always be caught in the wandering webs of sleep and, every night, I would dream of you. I always longed for the time I went to sleep each night, just so that in my dreams I would be able to see you; however, every morning, I would weep because the dream that contained you faded away.The time you left me was like a hot knife stabbing at my heart. People would pity me for they knew how much you meant to me. It was never pity I wanted, though. It was only you that I wanted. It was you that I wanted to talk to, to touch, and to hold. Everywhere, images and objects that related to you seemed to jump out at me more than ever. Every piece brought me closer to the feeling of being crushed, and every piece pierced my heart like the scythe from the Grim Reaper. I could not stop thinking of you. I could not stop having nightmares, and I could not stop longing for you.But then, a miracle appeared out of nowhere. You returned from that distant place I loathed. Your voice sang like music, and your tone changed back to the same way it was the first time we started talking. My desires were quenched as I held you that night, as we held each other so warm and tight. Hot knives were pulled away and replaced by Cupid's darts. All wounds were mended with the warmth of your presence. All the depressing thoughts of the past were instantly washed away, for it seemed nothing but happiness would enter the gate to my heart. I want you to know, I will always be there for you. I will always protect you under my wings, for you mean so much to me. I want you to know that I am full of joy now, for I know you have come back to me.",1

You tried to get me to love myself the way that you loved me, but I was insecure. My insecurities caused us to argue. I know we both made mistakes, but I fought with you more than I loved you, and I don't know why.I love you more than anything. You weren't just my love, you were my best friend.

"I wonder why you chose me, and why you are with me. I know we've gone through so much--so many hard times, but many more good times. We share the same things, we try to understand each other, even try to be there for each other as friends, as soul mates. I even ask myself why you chose to ask me to marry you and I have no answers, only your love--but that's all I will ever need.As I look into your eyes, I see how much you love me: I really understand how much you care about me now, too. Yes, it took me this long to understand everything. As you tell me that you're not sure that you trust me and, as I look for the answer, I ask myself: ""Has he given me any reasons why he doesn't? No.""We have both gone through so much in our lives. We've both been hurt and have lost all trust in others, but I ask you to give me a chance as I have given you one. I don't ask for much, only for you to love me as I am and not to hurt me, as I would never hurt you. I only wish to be by your side and with no one else.I enjoy doing things with you and spending time with you. I get upset because all I want are those times with you when we don't have much. As we reach our first two years together, I see that I really do want to spend my lifetime with you, to grow old together to the end of our lives.I know I don't tell you that I love you, but as the days go by, my love for you grows, and each day I thank God that I have you in my life. I know I get mad and upset sometimes. It is because my heart is so deeply in love with you, it scares me so! All I want is to take us away, away from the pain, and just share what we have with each other.Sometimes I feel lost and out of touch, but when you hold me, I feel safe. I could sit here and try to tell you just how I feel, only I can't find the words other than I am so happy we met and have stayed together after all we have gone through. From this moment on, we have each other and all the time in the world to be in each other's arms.You are my world! I am so happy we never walked away from each other. Stay with me and let's see the world together. I will give you and the kids what I can; please know that I will give you all my love, too.

Although you reciprocate some of these feelings, I'm sure you have no inkling of the strength of my love. My love for you is strong!You walked into my life a stranger a mere eight months ago, and my life hasn't been the same since. You are TRULY my gift from a higher power. ""Love"" is such a small word for what we share. You are amazing. You came into my life when I was at a low point: a time when I thought that the pain brought on by someone else would never end. During the moments I tried to turn away for fear of the unknown, you dug your heels into the ground and looked deep into my soul and stayed. You compromised your life and your goals to help me survive, and I owe much to you. Without you I could not even go on.You have become a beacon to me. Whenever I feel as though I've drifted too far into the discouragement that clouds my life, I can look up to find you guiding me to safety. I stay here, not because this place is home, but because YOU are home.After all that's happened to me in the past three years, I swore that I could never settle down again--that I could never give my heart and life completely to someone again. With great content and zero disparity, I take it all back.Most people will spend their entire lives searching for a perfection that almost never exists. Most people will spend their days looking at each person they encounter with questions as to whether or not they have found a reason, a season, or a lifetime. With you I have found an eternity. This is where I was meant to be. You are what my entire life has led up to. You are my very best friend, my lover, my protector, my teacher, and my one and only soul mate.I give my life to you--mind, body, and soul. I want you to hold me for the rest of my life as you do now, each and every night.I belong to you from this moment on.",1

"Congratulations on the happy day of your retirement! After these many years of working together, I will need to adjust to the idea that you are no longer in the next office.John, I have thoroughly enjoyed our association. I will always remember our trip to Mexico City to introduce the new power converters. I was amazed at the ease with which you conducted your presentations, undaunted by the skeptical comments. I have tried to pattern my own presentations after what I have seen you do so successfully. I hope I can do your reputation justice!Again, congratulations on a well-deserved retirement. Few have worked as hard as you have. I hope you will enjoy directing your energies into your other special interests. ",0
"I have just received your letter informing me that my insurance policy will not cover my daughter's surgery because you consider the surgery to be ""elective"" and we did not obtain authorization in advance. It never entered my mind that anyone would consider surgery that would prevent her paralysis and eventual death by suffocation to be ""elective."" Surely someone made a mistake in writing us this letter, or in defining what is ""elective.""I trust you have copies of her medical records in your possession. If not, I will have the neurosurgeon send them to you. I request that you review her case to see that her condition clearly was ""life-threatening"" and therefore not ""elective.""She now has a chance to lead a relatively normal life, for which we are grateful. To say we have no claim to insurance coverage for her surgery is to add severe insult to injury. I am confident that you will agree once you have seen the documentation. I will await your response before taking other action. ",0

"I am the Chairman of the Springfield Legislative Oversight Committee, representing over 150 concerned senior citizens in our community. We are worried about the proposed reduction of transportation services for the elderly, many of whom can no longer drive. These senior citizens depend on the van service to transport them to medical appointments and grocery stores. This service allows them to remain in their homes rather than to take up residence in costly nursing homes. They benefit greatly from such independence and the welfare department saves significant sums of money that would otherwise go to professional caretakers.We urge you argue against the cut in transportation services. The elderly in your district will be most appreciative and the welfare budget will stretch much further. ",0

My objective after meeting you was to remain friends and only friends. Except one thing went terribly wrong--I knew that divine love had me under attack. I was lost, alone, and afraid; the thought of loving you scared me. I have seen through the battle and come out on top. I love more than I could ever love any human being. You are my man, my ray of sunlight after the rain, my piece of cake when sweets are craved, and my everlasting joy. I love you, because you put me under love's divine attack.

Other schools in the district have tried the program with similar results, and I now intend to market the program nationally.Because of your well-known interest in educational technology, I would like to offer you the opportunity to invest in this innovative product.

I had no idea then that we would fall in love, but now that we have, I am so grateful. I am grateful that we wandered into one another's world so softly and unexpectedly. Nature took its course on our hearts and joined them in an unimaginable way.I want you to know that I love you from the very depths of my heart.

I sincerely feel that between the two of us, we have the kind of love that some people never get a chance to experience--ever.

I know that at one time you really did love me. I think in some ways you still do. When you had to go--for reasons only you know--you broke my heart completely.I didn't think I would ever be able to look at you again or see you again, nor did I ever even want too. After seeing you last week, though, I felt that I was over the hurt and wanted us to at least be friends.

"Your denial of our recent credit application has caught us off guard. As we were very confident of acceptance, we are hoping you will provide us with an explanation of your decision. We are aware that John's name has been confused with another H. Doe in the past, and fear that this may have been the case once more.

"As of May 28, 2019, I will no longer serve as chief engineer at Doe Corporation. With the decline in government contracts, I have decided to accept Doe's enticing offer for early retirement. My wife and I are looking forward to relaxing excursions in our motor home while we still enjoy good health.I have thoroughly enjoyed my work and my associations with you.

Once again, thank you for these rewarding years with Doe. ",0
"I need to tell you the full truth about the way I feel. The first time I ever saw you, I knew you were for me and I for you. The first eye contact between the two of us was the most powerful feeling of love from a man that I have ever had in my entire life. You took my breath away, and now that you're gone, I still find it hard to breathe.You treated me like a queen; you always were there for me and you showed me that gentlemen are still living in this society. I wish that I could touch you again, hold you, kiss your sweet lips, and spend the rest of my life in your arms. You are my soul mate and will always be in my heart more than any other man. I pray one day that you will realize this and come back to me.",1
"With each passing day, my love for you grows stronger. The more I walk beside you, the more I talk with you, and the more we trust each other, the more I feel I have no need to worry.

You have renewed my life, and I am forever grateful.",1

In addition to sparing ourselves bad publicity, we would spend less by building on solid ground. Besides, the Springfield site that the Coalition found for us is perfect! For these reasons the Doe proposal has my vote. ",0

"My very dear Sarah: The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days — perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write you again, I feel impelled to write lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more. Our movement may be one of a few days duration and full of pleasure — and it may be one of severe conflict and death to me. Not my will, but thine 0 God, be done. If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for my country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in, the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans upon the triumph of the Government, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution. And I am willing — perfectly willing — to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt. But, my dear wife, when I know that with my own joys I lay down nearly all of yours, and replace them in this life with cares and sorrows — when, after having eaten for long years the bitter fruit of orphanage myself, I must offer it as their only sustenance to my dear little children — is it weak or dishonorable, while the banner of my purpose floats calmly and proudly in the breeze, that my unbounded love for you, my darling wife and children, should struggle in fierce, though useless, contest with my love of country? I cannot describe to you my feelings on this calm summer night, when two thousand men are sleeping around me, many of them enjoying the last, perhaps, before that of death — and I, suspicious that Death is creeping behind me with his fatal dart, am communing with God, my country, and thee. I have sought most closely and diligently, and often in my breast, for a wrong motive in thus hazarding the happiness of those I loved and I could not find one. A pure love of my country and of the principles have often advocated before the people and “the name of honor that I love more than I fear death” have called upon me, and I have obeyed. Sarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield. The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when God willing, we might still have lived and loved together and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me — perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar — that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name. Forgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have oftentimes been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness, and struggle with all the misfortune of this world, to shield you and my children from harm. But I cannot. I must watch you from the spirit land and hover near you, while you buffet the storms with your precious little freight, and wait with sad patience till we meet to part no more. But, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the garish day and in the darkest night — amidst your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours — always, always; and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath; or the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by. Sarah, do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again. As for my little boys, they will grow as I have done, and never know a father’s love and care. Little Willie is too young to remember me long, and my blue-eyed Edgar will keep my frolics with him among the dimmest memories of his childhood. Sarah, I have unlimited confidence in your maternal care and your development of their characters. Tell my two mothers his and hers I call God’s blessing upon them. O Sarah, I wait for you there! Come to me, and lead thither my children. Sullivan",1
"Honey, you know with you by my side, my day seems happier and full of love. When I heard that you never felt so much in love, I just wanted to be with you, to hug and kiss you until we both ran out of breath. I must be the luckiest girl in the world because I have your love. Every time I think about you, I can't help but smile. You're the reason I smile all the time now. I love you, Honey. I heard that you cherish everything between you and me. That's really great.

I refuse to hide my feelings for you any longer; next time we are walking down a busy street and you lean over to kiss me, my lips will allow yours to kiss mine, and I will not care what others will think of us. You are a wonderful father, and I am proud that you are my husband.Love you always!",1

"Since you have welcomed me into your life, I have never known such unconditional love. You are truly a gift from God and I give thanks every day that you are a part of my life. You have made my life complete.There was a time that I used to cry and tell my friends that I would die alone if I ever lost you! What a terrible thought, but it is true. I had no idea what God had in mind for me. I can never express how I feel with words. When we make love I really think we are cementing our love. It is truly the most intimate way I know to express my love. Mere words are not nearly enough. Actions, in this case, speak volumes. I will love you with all my heart, mind, soul, and body--forever and a day.You've shown me what real love is; like I have never known before, but only dreamed of knowing. My dream of all dreams has finally come true. I guess it's true. Good things do come to those who wait!",1

"As a member of (Name of Church), you've experienced firsthand the family feeling of our community. Even through the significant growth of the past years, the congregation has retained warmth, fellowship, and sincere connection among its members. And our members don't only worship together; they also engage themselves in daily activities and causes to benefit the community of (Name of Town) as a whole.One particularly established and valued community project begun by members years ago is the (Name of Church) soup kitchen. Each week, members donate their time and resources to gather and then serve the poor and hungry residents of our community, and each week the visitors of the soup kitchen are nourished by the food served and by the compassion of those serving.This valued and unique community service requires support from members, of course, and it is with this concern in mind that we are writing to you today. Each week, the soup kitchen requires members to fetch supplies, cook the food, prepare the service area, and then serve the visitors of the kitchen. We would warmly welcome your involvement in any of these activities. However, we also would like to emphasize our need for funds. Although donated materials cover most of the soup kitchen's needs, each week the kitchen must purchase some food and drink to complete the offerings of the week. To help us cover these costs and continue providing the best service to our visitors, we hope you will consider using the enclosed form and envelope to donate $20 or $30 to this worthy cause.Thank you for your understanding and support.

How pleased I am to be a meaningful part of your life. I'll always be in love with you--only with you.I know we can't get together right now; we are just too far apart, and I perfectly understand that.

It's getting harder and is starting to drive me crazy and make me think about you, more and more. Although we're apart now, I can assure you that it doesn't change the way I feel about you. You're such a blessing to me. Thank you for everything, for loving me. I mean it.And one more thing--I really appreciate you.

"As his parent, your concern regarding this news is understandable. Your son Eric is failing history and English. In addition to his failing grades, Eric has poor attendance records in both classes taught by different teachers. On the two history exams that Eric did take, he received a passing score of 65%. Unfortunately, he failed to show up for two other exams and therefore received a failing score on both. In English, Eric missed three out of five days last week.Eric has received several reprimands and detention. My secretary has left two messages on your answering machine as well as sent two letters to your home. Only by writing to you at work can I feel certain you will receive notice of the situation.

I know the average mileage is 10,000 per year so it is natural to assume that I would drive about that far, but I do not.I have driven only 1,400 miles this last year and my current odometer reading is 4,200. If you wish to check the reading after a year, I will be happy to cooperate. In the meantime, please correct my policy and adjust the premium accordingly. ",0

"I'm not quite sure where to begin. I know this past week has been a mess, and it's been both of our faults. I'm not just directing that at you. I have had ten million things run through my mind the past few days, and I am going to try and get a few of them out right now.For one, I do cherish your friendship. Like I said in one of my messages, you and I have shared conversations about our lives and our families that I would never share with anyone else. The main reason for that is because I trust you, and you listen to me, as I do to you. I can say that I have had some of the most wonderful times with you that I have ever had in my entire life--so much laughing and smiling. I had told you once before that when you speak, I hold onto every word that comes out of your mouth. It's like it's engraved in the back of my mind forever. I don't know why you have that effect on me. Maybe it's the fact that we've become such good friends. To be quite honest with you, I don't trust people very easily anymore, and I could probably say the same for you. I think that is why I did let that wall down and let you into my life and my heart--because I felt safe. So let me ask you, why do you think that I'm building it back up?Let me explain a little what I want in my life. I want someone to share my laughter and my fears. Someone to listen and to be there when I feel like the world is crashing down on me, and I want to give that same courtesy back to them in return. I don't need someone standing at my door waiting for me to get home, or to be around constantly, because that makes me a little jittery. I do think that since you and I have spent so much in-depth time together, I have become a little dependent on you being there and wanting to talk to you. That doesn't necessarily mean seeing you every day, or talking to you in a three-hour phone call, just the reassurance of knowing that you are still there. ""Hi, how are you. How was your day""...just stuff like that. Is that too much for you? It sometimes feels like you only call when you know I am upset. It seems like you hardly ever call just because you want to.You tell me how important it is to you to have me in your life, but as what? Then you say that if I would find someone who makes me happy, you wouldn't want to hold me back from that. Don't you understand how happy I am with you? When you say things like that, it just confuses me. I'm not sure how you differentiate between a relationship and a friendship, but I am going to tell you how I separate the two.For one, I don't spend the weekends with my friends, holding them, talking to them, being intimate, that's just not me. It never has been and never will be. The things that we've shared (and again this is just the way I think--you might disagree), the things that have been between us have been very special to me. They go beyond friendship. Like the night we went to Hetaeras; the way you looked at me, and just the feeling that I get when I am around you. Little do you know whether you want to admit it or not, we have been in a relationship.You yourself have even said that it was the only relationship that has been this special to you, and you've never been so happy. So let yourself be happy, but you have to give a little in return. You have seen the type of person I am, and all that I want to give. I do that for two reasons. For one, it makes you happy; and for two, some people have never gotten a chance to be treated that way, and I think everyone in their life should experience it just once. I wanted you to experience it. Making you happy, seeing you happy...I truly enjoyed that. Well, it's my turn for me to say, I've never been treated like that, and I want to be. I want to feel like I am a special person, that the person I am with enjoys being with me, and in return they clearly show it. Not just meaning physically, but in other ways too. I need to know that someone wants me to be as happy as I want to make them.I feel like you want me around, but you don't want to put out the effort that would be involved with having a relationship. You enjoy what I give you and don't want to lose me, but you don't want to give much in return. A friendly relationship relieves you of the pressures of a romantic or intimate relationship. I think that is why you stress being just friends. That's fine if that is what you want. But you have to understand what friendship is. Friendship still involves giving and taking. You still call friends and you still hang out with friends. But friendship doesn't involve intimacy. I can't have you hugging me and kissing me. You can't expect us to spend the night together. Friends certainly don't have sex.As far as intimacy goes, I am not physically intimate with you because it's a need. I am intimate because I'm just showing you how much I enjoy being with you and having you in my life. When I hug you or kiss you, it's my way of showing you that I do, in fact, care about you, yes, as a friend, but also as a lot more.How do you want us to be? You have to make a decision. We can be friends or we can continue exploring our relationship. But if we are working on the relationship, I expect you to show me your feelings. Show me what I mean to you. Don't just tell me when you are afraid I will leave you. I need to know you want me to stay by your actions. I need to know that you respect my feelings and that you understand them. I need you to give a part of your life to me and not expect that I will do all the work in the relationship.Do you understand now what it takes to have a relationship? It is simple. Give back to me the things I do for you and the way I make you feel. Well, not even that much. But give something in return. Do something special for me. Just think about what you would like me to do for you and do it for me. Think about what would make me smile and do it. Anything worthwhile involves a little work. Is it worth it to you? Is our relationship worth enough for you to put forth some effort to make me happy the way I work to make you happy?If it isn't, I understand. In the beginning, I don't think either one of wanted a real relationship, but it looks like one developed anyway. If it developed because I pushed you into it, then I am sorry. I'll back off.I can't continue seeing you and still feel the way that I feel lately. You give me a mixture of extreme happiness--together with confusion.",1

"Never did I imagine that, at my young age, I could fall in love. I always believed love to be something built out of maturity and respect.Words can never express the way I feel, but I'd like to try. First of all, you made my heart beat faster with every touch. I loved holding you, kissing you, just being with you. You were everything I wanted and admired. If I had one wish, it would be to feel the thrill of knowing that out of all the people in the world, you could choose me. I was the one you needed; your best friend and you were mine. And now we are apart and I am lost without you.I pray every night for you to come back. Every time I think of you, I decide: ""Okay, think of the last happy memory when you were together; then move on."" I never can.You are all I think about, and I simply cannot imagine life without you. I would like to be in your life again if you feel that our relationship could work. Let's meet and make and talk about this.",1

Having trained long and hard and having grown to work expertly as a team, our (Name of Team) placed strongly in the regional finals and earned honorable recognitions in the local press.This year promises to be even more exciting than the last.

"Last night was more intense and more passionate than I could have ever imagined. We are the perfect match, you and I, the perfect lovers and, finding you, coming together with you, was a douse of cold water in the middle of a drought. All that is inside of me was nourished by you--the sparks of hope, beauty, and life. Now that we are apart, my longing to share another night with you and share our secret passion again fills my every waking moment. Until then, I will hold the memory of our passion dear to me.",1
"As the day fades away and the night slips upon me, I find myself clinging to my prayers for comfort. Every night I pray to God that he will keep you in His arms. I pray He will keep you out of harm's way until we can finally be together again.Sometimes, it seems so unfair that they kept you longer than they said they would. I realize, though, when you love a soldier you cannot expect life to be dependable. You asked me what I wanted to do about us. Well, my love, I do not want our relationship to end, that's for sure.Just because we will not be able to see each other for a long time is no reason for us to give up hope. If you really love someone, the time and distance apart should not make a difference. Two years is not that long--relatively speaking. I will continue to wait for you. I wouldn't care how long I had to wait. I would wait forever, if that's what it took. So now you have my answer. I love you. I hope you feel the same way I do.",1

"If only I were a clever woman, I could describe to you my gorgeous bird, how you unite in yourself the beauties of form, plumage, and song! I would tell you that you are the greatest marvel of all ages, and I should only be speaking the simple truth.  But to put all this into suitable words, my superb one, I should require a voice far more harmonious than that which is bestowed upon my species – for I am the humble owl that you mocked at only lately, therefore, it cannot be. I will not tell you to what degree you are dazzling and to the birds of sweet song who, as you know, are none the less beautiful and appreciative. I am content to delegate to them the duty of watching, listening and admiring, while to myself I reserve the right of loving; this may be less attractive to the ear, but it is sweeter far to the heart. I love you, I love you.  my Victor; I can not reiterate it too often; I can never express it as much as I feel it. I recognise you in all the beauty that surrounds me  in form, in colour, in perfume, in harmonious sound: all of these mean you to me. You are superior to all.  I see and admire – you are all! You are not only the solar spectrum with the seven luminous colours, but the sun himself, that illumines, warms, and revivifies!  This is what you are, and I am the lowly woman that adores you.",1

I don't believe happiness is even possible without true love between two people. I am so happy when you tell me that you love me. When you say those words, my heart beats faster and my voice is unsteady when I reply that I love you, too.I can never know enough about you.

I know you are the only one for me.Being away from you is so hard now. I want to be with you this moment, even as I write to you. When I think of this separation as a test, then I can deal with it. If this is what it takes to eventually be with you, then I can go through it.I want to thank you for coming into my life. You took me by surprise. I didn't think that I could be so lucky as to find you, but now that I have, I don't ever want to let go. You have taught me the true meaning of love. You have brought me more love, joy, and happiness than anyone has ever shown me. I have so much joy in my life now, and I owe it all to you. I love you so much! You and I have shared so much together already, and we have been through so much already that you have become an essential part of my life. I couldn't ever let you go now.I love you because you bring out the best in me. I love your terrific sense of humor. Every time I look at you, my heart skips a beat. You're the only one who holds the key to my heart. You always say what I need to hear. Love is just what you mean to me, and you mean everything. I doubt if either one of us thought we could have met someone on the Internet and fall in love the way we did, but it happened, and I have no regrets. In fact, it is the best thing that ever happened to me, and I am very grateful. Words could not express how much joy you have brought me.I am writing this to you now to let you know I will never forget the day we crossed paths. Over and over I replay in my mind our online chat and then our first telephone conversation! You make me feel so happy and complete.

You are my best friend, my lover, and my soul mate all in one. We have both gone through so much in our lives. We've both been hurt and have lost trust in others, but I'm glad you've given me another chance as I've given you one. I just ask you to love me as I am and not to hurt me. I want you to know that I won't hurt you.From this moment on, we have each other and can enjoy being in each other's arms. When I say I love you, I truly mean it. Of all the people in this world, you're the only one I run to now. Your name was inscribed in my heart before I ever knew it belonged to you. From the moment we met all those years ago, I knew you were the one. I whisper your name every morning when I wake up and whenever I think of you. I am who I am now because of you, and without you I would start to fall apart. You have given me a new outlook on the world and, through the times when darkness covered it, you were always the light.",1

"""Stop looking!"" That's what everyone kept telling me. So, stop looking is what I did. And that day when I was at the mall, and you were the salesperson, you had the sweetest smile I had ever seen complemented by such beautiful eyes. My heart skipped a beat. I couldn't catch my breath, and the only thing I could really say is, ""Thanks, but I'm just looking."" I wanted to say so much more than that. I wanted to stare into your eyes and talk to your heart, but I was really nervous, so nervous that I just wanted to leave. But I stayed; you were so helpful and so genuine with the compliments you gave me.My mind worked hard thinking of clever ways to ask you out. But I was worried about rejection again. As I left, I felt no peace. I wanted to run back in and ask you to dinner. My heart was trying to pull my body back into the store, but all that kept happening was my mind kept taking over, moving one foot in front of the other, walking around the mall aimlessly, thinking about what I could say to you and asking God to give me the right words to say to you.Then a burst of confidence came over me, rehearsing the lines over and over in my head. I decided to walk back in, and I told myself, ""If she's standing all alone, that will be a sign I should go up to her."" So, as I walked past the store, there you were, standing alone, right in front of the cash register. But my mind took over again, and I marched right out of the mall and into my car.Thinking of how much of a fool I am, I started to imagine different scenarios of rejection and acceptance. As I returned to work, I was clouded with thoughts about you. So, as my confidence built up, I asked God to close all the doors, take away all the distractions, and anything else that was not from Him. And so He did.After work, I drove back to the mall, again the experience of meeting you, seeing your beautiful smile with those beautiful eyes, and your sweet voice. I hurried there and as I walked through the mall and into your store, you walked out--I knew it was a sign that you came from above.So I caught up with you, nervous as can be, and gasped, ""I know this is sudden, but would you like to go get a hamburger?"" And, with an angelic voice, you answered, ""Yes!"" My heart started to pound and butterflies fluttered in my stomach. Joy filled my heart. I wanted to dance like a child, but my feel would not move. All I could feel was my heart pounding.Thanks for the great time. Hope I can see you again soon.",1

You are the true and unconditional love in my heart, and I can't even think of living without you. You are my angel, you are the one ray of hope in my life. I don't think it's possible for me to live without you. Even the thought of living without you makes me uncomfortable.But I don't know what has happened to you. You are not behaving the way you used to. Now whatever I say, you think I am lying. I just want to tell you now that what you're thinking is completely wrong. I am not that kind of a guy. You think that I am after someone else, but this is not true. I know you will say that you will not ever leave me, but I want to see you act like you did before, my sweet babe.And please forgive me for all the hurt that I have caused you. Please, I beg of you to forgive me and come back to me. I love you, and I always will, until the day that I die. Hopefully, when that day comes, I will still have you by my side and you will be the last face that I see.

"I regretfully submit my resignation from my position as personnel director, effective two weeks from today. Although I love my job, my first priority is my family, and I have decided to stay home with my newborn child. When I first learned that I was pregnant, resignation was the last thing on my mind. But, now that she is born, I find I lack the courage to leave her in the care of a stranger.Your confidence in my abilities and genuine concern for my professional growth make this decision especially difficult. I will be forever grateful for the invaluable expertise I acquired while under your guidance. Also, the friendships I have developed here have helped make my years with the company successful and productive. My co-workers have been among the finest people I have ever known.I highly regard your offer to reinstate me to my former position once I decide to reenter the job market; indeed, I can think of no company for which I would rather work.

"I am writing this letter because I can't bear the pain in my heart when you are so far away from me. Although I can't see you or hear your voice, writing these words and expressing these feelings somehow helps, and it somehow connects us across the time and space of our separation.I still remember the day when I first kissed you. A tear rolled down your cheek, and you said, ""Don't ever leave me."" On that day, I swore that I'd be there for you, and be forever by your side. I swore that I'd forever love you and be yours and yours alone.My conviction is as strong today as it was then, and it will remain so through my last breath. For the energy that you bring into my life, for the joy and passion, for the kindness and affection, I will be forever grateful. Whether I am young or old, or I am sick or healthy, you are more important to me than anything. All of my love is yours.",1

This resignation must become effective no later than two weeks from today's date.I have concluded that my contributions here are unrewarded and my ideas ignored. I have much to offer and feel frustrated that I am consistently passed over for special projects. It is important to me to work for a company that encourages creativity rather than restricts it. Although your compensation has been fair, you have been unable to provide other types of incentives that I need.Nevertheless, my time here has not been wasted. I have gained experience and have honed my skills. I have worked with a dedicated group who has earned my respect and admiration. I sincerely wish co-workers well in their future endeavors.Because you have indicated that my work is excellent, I would appreciate a positive recommendation from you should any prospective employers inquire about my qualifications. If you feel you are unable to satisfy this request, I would sincerely value an opportunity to discuss with you any reservations you may have. ",0

Our company has already contributed to several charitable organizations this year and our funds are depleted. ",0
"As time goes by and we're apart, I think of how things could have been. What we could have said or done to work things through. I would have been more understanding and not so judgmental, more loving and not so hurtful. I would have told you I loved you and cherished you more often. I would have promised you that there can never be, nor will ever be another person who I admire like you, or who has reached the depths of my heart like you have. I would have told you that I'm so very proud of how far you've come and the things you have accomplished.But how could I ever find the words or the actions to explain to you just how much I love you? It would take a million lifetimes to even comprehend my feelings. If such words were easy to express, I would have told you that you took my breath away the very first time I met you. I would have told you that you made be believe in love the first time you kissed me or that you stole my heart the moment you uttered those magical words. I would have told you that every time I looked into your eyes, I saw my destiny. My one and only. My soul mate, my best friend, my lover, my husband, my inspiration, and the father of my children.I can still close my eyes and feel the softness of your lips against mine and your tender fingers as they caress and explore my body. I would have told you that my knees and my entire body would tremble every time you looked deep down into my eyes and explored my very soul. You made me feel like you could read my innermost thoughts. Life just isn't anything without you.I wish that there was a way to make time stop, so we could go back to the time when we where happy. We both know that before we can go back to when we were one, we need to rethink some things about ourselves, in order to make this relationship last. I hope that one day we can find a way to get past this, but until that day comes, I want you to know that I will wait for you a lifetime if necessary, because my love for you is never ending. Don't let our love fade away and our memories scatter to the winds. I'll wait until you come back into my arms (where you belong). I'll love you from now until death and forever onward. There is nothing or no one that will ever change that.",1

It's hard for me to hide it, but I must! Now that I know that I am just your friend, I will always be just that.

"I feel incredibly fortunate to have you in my life. Please don't mind if I appear to be arrogant in talking about our love, and please don't mind if I appear to gloat about our love. Don't mind if I appear to be absent-mindedly smiling all the time--I'm only thinking about you.It's true: over this first year together, we have been through a lot of ups and downs. Like most couples, we had our share of good and bad--arguments, temporary breakups, heated discussions, and passion. We've been through it all.What is unique about our relationship is that we go through each difficulty, each complexity, and always come out of it loving each other all the more.

I live for the day that I can sit next to you and whisper into your ear and tell you that I love you, and kiss you ever so lightly, but passionately, on your lips, and to look into your beautiful eyes as you take my breath away. I live for that first look into your eyes, that first passionate kiss, that first embrace, and that first time that we make love together.

Your smile is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen--even more beautiful than a rose blooming or the sun setting over the mountains. When I hug you, I know that you care by the way your heart beats against mine.When I am with you, the world and its troubles just fade away. When I have a bad day, I know you are there for me. I'll do anything to try to make you smile when you are having a bad day, too. I'll kiss your soft, sweet lips and look into those beautiful eyes and try to make them sparkle with happiness. I was about to give up all hope of finding love until I laid eyes on you.I always thought love was just a word people say to talk discouraged souls into dating again. I was wrong, though, because without you I would not know love was real. I realize now that you are my reason for getting up in the morning. God must have put me on this earth just to be with you. And I thank Him every night for sending you to me. Without you I think I would be still be lying in a pile of my own troubles.There is no mountain that reaches higher than my love for you. No river is deeper than the depth of my love. My love stretches farther than all the oceans in the world. It is the kind of love most people only dream about. All the money in the world or all the possessions in the world could never be more important to me than you are. You are my heart and soul. You are everything to me..When I hear your voice, my heart skips a beat. Ever since we met, my heart beats more rapidly. Just for you to be mine and be with you is more than I could ask for. All my life I thought perfect love was only a dream but, now that I found you, I know it can be real.I hope that we can be together forever because without you, I will be nothing. Before you, I never thought highly of myself. I need to have your love, just to be all that I can be. You hold the key to my heart and keep me involved in life.

"You have been wonderful, my Juliette, all through these dark and violent days. If I needed love, you brought it to me, bless you! When, in my hiding places, always dangerous, after a night of waiting, I heard the key of my door trembling in your fingers, peril and darkness were no longer round me–what entered then was light! We must never forget those terrible, but so sweet, hours when you were close to me in the intervals of fighting. Let us remember all our lives that dark little room, the ancient hangings, the two armchairs, side by side, the meal we ate off the corner of the table, the cold chicken you had brought; our sweet converse, your caresses, your anxieties, your devotion. You were surprised to find me calm and serene. Do you know whence came both calmness and serenity? From you…",1
"I have waited so long to be able to wake up every day and see your beautiful face. I'm so thankful that you're here, that I never have to be apart from you. Writing this now makes tears come to my eyes. I have such strong love for you that I could burst into tears just because I love you. Sure, I tell you that I love you, and I try to show you, too, but no matter what I do for the rest of both our lives, you will never know exactly what I feel inside. How you make me feel is something that can only be felt, but never explained. You take my breath away with some of the things you say. Just the way I feel when I lie down with you, your arms wrapped around me, holding me like I'm your baby, I am surprised at how tears can come to my eyes out of joy. My love for you is so strong that even I don't always realize how much I love you and cherish you.You say I'm perfect and that you're the luckiest guy in the world, but you don't see what I see when I look at you. To me, you make me feel so lucky to even have you in my life or even to glance my way. I don't know what I did to deserve you in my life, you are so unbelievably perfect. And you are the most perfect boyfriend, fiancÃ©, friend, person, human being in the world.You're my life, and you have my whole heart. Wherever you go, I'm always there with you, because you have my heart and my soul. I adore you and every part of you, especially your nice eyes and perfect, luscious lips. I'm getting chills just thinking about it! They are so, well--inviting, just as everything else is about you.You, my baby doll, are the key to my heart. You are my other half, my soul mate, and I will be so happy the day that I walk down the aisle with you and say, ""I do,"" because, Baby, I DO!! I love you, and don't ever forget that.",1
"My name is John Doe, and we met in Eric Johnson' office last January. At that time you mentioned that you worked in the legal department at Springfield Associates. I am an attorney at Doe & Doe in Centerville, and am planning to make a change. Most of my legal experience is in banking and finance, but I would like to branch out into environmental law.I graduated from Centerville University College of Law and was the case notes editor of the Law Journal. I took three courses in environmental law, and did my clerkship with a law firm specializing in environmental issues. Would you mind giving me suggestions about who I could contact in Springfield?

I can't get any answers!All I know is that I am thankful you have come into my life and made me feel so loved! I keep hoping that this will never end. Being loved by you is the only thing I need now. When you hold me in your arms, I pray that the moment will never end! I need you once again to show me there's hope in love. Thank you for that. I am missing you terribly now. Tell me what I can do to bring you to me now, to fall into your arms, to hear you say you love me and to see your smile when you look at me.

"As a fellow member of the (Name of Town) community, I am writing to share news of an important initiative recently suggested at the monthly town meeting. A group of residents, including myself, instigated a discussion about the need for wheelchair friendly access to the public buildings within our community. Currently, the public library, the town hall, and a handful of public schools are without easy access points for individuals in wheelchairs. Of course, this situation places a number of residents at a significant disadvantage; thus the problem must be resolved.After a good deal of discussion, residents at the town meeting decided to initiate a private fundraising campaign to attract attention to the cause and to collect funds to assist the city in paying for the necessary renovations. Thus, in the hope that you will connect with our cause, we have enclosed with this letter a brochure describing the situation and the need. We have also enclosed a donation form, and we hope you will consider making a contribution at one of the three levels suggested.We thank you for your understanding and willingness to transform our community into a better home for all of its residents.

"Six years have passed since our first encounter, but in those years, we have made many memories and parted ways a few times. But whenever we parted ways, we have been led back to each other as if there is an eternal spark between us--and perhaps there is. Ever since you first entered my life, I felt as if God sent one of his angels down to me, and this is no joke. Over the last few months, I've felt as if my heart has grown stronger because of the love I have for you. This love gets stronger and stronger with each passing day.I long for your soft, warm, and loving touch, not only at sunrise each day, but at each sunset and every night as well. I think and dream about you 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Just hearing your sweet voice at night soothes any blows I've taken during each long day. With a woman like you, I look forward to nightfall and wish that night would come sooner, so we could be together in dreamland.In October, I will show you my true self and all that is in my heart that I can only vaguely describe to you here. You captured my heart fully this year and I'm glad it was you that did it, for it is just the beginning of the journey that we'll take. The words of this letter cannot fully describe what and how I feel about you, but they are the words and the small voice of my heart. You are a one-of-a kind woman. I want you to know that. I cannot wait to finally have you in my strong arms and declare you safe from the world's harm. I cannot wait to feel your soft lips against mine. I cannot wait to feel your heartbeat in union with mine. I cannot wait to look into your bright, beautiful hazel eyes and tell you that I love you. I also cannot wait to run my fingers through your long, flowing blonde hair to ease your worries.Last but not least, I cannot wait to actually wake up in the morning with you lying next to me. As I said earlier, this letter is close to my heart and what I feel for you, and only a sample of what is to come. I have to go now. I want you to know that I promise to love and cherish you for the rest of my natural life. Never forget this letter. You are my one and only. I love you, I loved you the year we met, I love you now, and I will never stop loving you.",1

"I have waited patiently for one whole day without news of you; I have been counting the time and that’s what it must be. But a second day– I can see no reason for it, unless my servants have grown lazy or been captured by the enemy, for I dare not put the blame on you, my beautiful angel: I am too confident of your affection–which is certainly due to me, for my love was never greater, nor my desire more urgent; that is why I repeat this refrain in all my letters: come, come, come, my dear love. Honor with your presence the man who, if only he were free, would go a thousand miles to throw himself at your feet and never move from there. As for what is happening here, we have drained the water from the moat, but our cannons are not going to be in place until Friday when, God willing, I will dine in town.

All of a sudden here I am alone on this rainy day, wondering what you are doing. It is okay, rainy days will come and go, but my love for you will never leave my heart.

The times we shared together are times I will always cherish! I am looking forward to all the happy moments together we will have in the future!The day you had to leave to go overseas is also a day I will never forget, because that day, my love, you took with you my heart and soul. You looked at me with that smile on your face and promised everything would be fine--you said the Navy put us together and would keep us together until the end of time! We held each other tight with tears in our eyes. We didn't want to let go, but the time came to say goodbye. I hugged and kissed you and told you, ""I love you."" You held me so tight that day and looked into my eyes and said, ""I love you, and I will come back to you."" I got in our car and just sat there, and the tears wouldn't stop. I looked up from the steering wheel and surprise! You ran back to me! You kissed me one last time and said, ""Believe me, I will be back.""This is a cost I know I have to pay, my love. I know there will be other times you will have to go away, and the pain will not stop until I have you back by my side. Fight for our country, then hurry back home to your loving wife!

I only hoped that in my lifetime I would find that one true love that only a few are lucky enough to find. I have been given that gift, the gift of true love. In you I have found the one true love for a lifetime. I have found the most amazing man in the world. You are everything I had dreamed of and more.

You weren't really my type, but once I got to know you more each day, I learned that love doesn't have a type. Love can go either way and, if you hide from love (like I hid from your love), eventually it will find you anyway, like yours found me. Sometimes love can change directions, or there might not be enough to go around fully. Even though we had some problems, I always loved you.",1

You bring a smile to my face, a sparkle to my eyes, and a tear to my cheek.Your voice is like a sweet song I heard for the first time. You take my breath away with the simplest words your lips utter. You make me feel weightless, as though I could float up and touch the heavens above. You make me look at life through new eyes, eyes that have never seen the light of day until now. I feel as though I am using all my senses for the first time and, suddenly, everything I once knew is now unfamiliar to me. You fill every cell in my being with joy, love, and happiness. You make me want to stand up and scream at the top of my lungs, ""I love you, more than words can say."" You make my heart soar, like a bird in flight. But most of all, you are you, and I love you.It is this intense power you have over me that gives me strength and hope, and gives my life new meaning. You are my sun, my moon, my evening star, my light, my life, my love. You are my destiny. You are the only one, the man that I love. As I write this love letter to you, I find the words come naturally to me. It's as if this pen is an extension of my heart, and my heart is guiding it across the paper. Every letter, every word, every stroke is meant to be because we are soul mates, and our love was meant to be.",1

The prospect of remaining two months without hearing about you had been extremely disagreeable to me: that is to say, your little note was more than welcome. I hope you are laying up a stock of good air and that you will come back to us in October. As for me, I think I shall not go anywhere; I shall stay in the country, where I spend the whole day in front of my open window or in the garden. We have promised each other — haven’t we? — to be at least great friends. If you will only not change your mind! For there are no promises that are binding; such things cannot be ordered at will. It would be a fine thing, just the same, in which I hardly dare believe, to pass our lives near each other, hypnotized by our dreams: your patriotic dream, our humanitarian dream, and our scientific dream. Of all those dreams the last is, I believe, the only legitimate one. I mean by that that we are powerless to change the social order and, even if we were not, we should not know what to do; in taking action, no matter in what direction, we should never be sure of not doing more harm than good, by retarding some inevitable evolution. From the scientific point of view, on the contrary, we may hope to do something; the ground is solider here, and any discovery that we may make, however small, will remain acquired knowledge. See how it works out: it is agreed that we shall be great friends, but if you leave France in a year it would be an altogether too Platonic friendship, that of two creatures who would never see each other again. Wouldn’t it be better for you to stay with me? I know that this question angers you, and that you don’t want to speak of it again — and then, too, I feel so thoroughly unworthy of you from every point of view. I thought of asking your permission to meet you by chance in Fribourg. But you are staying there, unless I am mistaken, only one day, and on that day you will of course belong to our friends the Kovalskis. Believe me your very devoted Peirre Curie",1
"When I see you walk by, all else around me disappears--the trees, the birds, the cars, and the sky. Nothing remains but the intensity of my longing for you. Nothing remains but my wish to bring you into my life.I have waited too long to express these feelings. Each day I let slip by is a great loss. Each day without you is a day without purpose. You are beautiful. You are special and beyond compare. I need you in my life.",1

"Our road to friendship has been a little less than conventional, but it has worked for us. I know you will always be there for me. That's one of the reasons I think I may be falling in love with you.I know you do not have time for a relationship right now and that you may even be afraid to commit to me, but I am patient. I will be by your side, regardless of my status with you. I have never felt so attached to a person in my life. I love talking to you or just being around you.I also realize that it is hard to tell somebody that you do not love them as they love you. Please, don't ever be afraid to be honest with me, because I will always be your friend.Mainly, I wanted you to know I will wait for you. I don't need fancy gifts or all of your time. All I need is to know you care, and I believe you do already. I love your hugs and encouraging words, and I want to say, ""thank you"" for everything. I have loved you as my friend for a while now, and I would love to love you even more.",1
"If only you knew how much your absence has pained me. I no longer have that safe place to go to, that special place that was you, safe and secure, and so full of love. I have never experienced such terrible pain which comes from knowing I'll never get to see or hear from you again as my love.To have given me so much, to have made so many promises, telling me that I could put all my trust in you and that you'd never let me down, then to cut me out of your life in such a manner was cruel. But you decided my fate. By coming into my life, giving me something wonderful and making me believe in you, only to take it all away has sentenced me to a life of emptiness. I don't think I can ever trust anyone with my love again. I'll never know what it's like to be intimate with someone again.You moved out leaving me behind with nothing but memories. This pain is my lifetime sentence for loving you.But I refuse to be bitter. So I wish you a good and happy life and hope that we can someday get back into touch as friends.",1

Jane said that your home owner's insurance policy may cover the damage, so she told me to wait until she had called the company. I'll be glad to follow through on the repairs.

"You will be sorry, and surprised, and puzzled, to hear what a queer illness I have had ever since you went. I sent for the doctor, and said, “Give me some medicine. for I’m tired.” He said, “Nonsense and stuff! You don’t want medicine: go to bed!” I said, “No; it isn’t the sort of tiredness that wants bed. I’m tired in the face.” He looked a little grave, and said, “Oh, it’s your nose that’s tired: a person often talks too much when he thinks he knows a great deal.” I said, “No, it isn’t the nose. Perhaps it’s the hair.” Then he looked rather grave, and said, “Now I understand: you’ve been playing too many hairs on the pianoforte.” “No, indeed I haven’t!” I said, “and it isn’t exactly the hair: it’s more about the nose and chin.” Then he looked a good deal graver, and said, “Have you been walking much on your chin lately?” I said, “No.” “Well!” he said, “it puzzles me very much. Do you think it’s in the lips?” “Of course!” I said. “That’s exactly what it is!” Then he looked very grave indeed, and said, “I think you must have been giving too many kisses.” “Well,” I said, “I did give one kiss to a baby child, a little friend of mine.” “Think again,” he said; “are you sure it was only one?” I thought again, and said, “Perhaps it was eleven times.” Then the doctor said, “You must not give her any more till your lips are quite rested again.” “But what am I to do?” I said, “because you see, I owe her a hundred and eighty-two more.” Then he looked so grave that tears ran down his cheeks, and he said, “You may send them to her in a box.” Then I remembered a little box that I once bought at Dover, and thought I would someday give it to some little girl or other. So I have packed them all in it very carefully. Tell me if they come safe or if any are lost on the way.” — If you give me one kiss and you can only kiss me if I say ‘kiss me’ and I will never say ‘kiss me’ because I am a respectable widow and I wouldn’t let any man kiss me unless I was sure of the wedding ring — Stella.",1

My lips lock up because my love is so strong, and the words that I want to say just can't be expressed. Sometimes I want to open up and tell you how I feel, but I guess I'm just too scared.

"Things could not be any better than they are now, with you in my life. You are my inspiration and you're the one who stands by me through everything and gives me a shoulder to cry on. Most of all, you make me know that I am loved. There is no one that makes me feel whole the way that you do. You mean everything to me.There is nothing that I would not do for you, and there is no one else I would want to share my life with. You are the reason I get up in the morning and the reason I go to work, and you make me look at life from a new perspective. I have never met anyone as wonderful as you are. I really miss you when we are apart.There are so many things that I am grateful for now, I can't even count them. You have been there for me through thick and thin. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to get to know you and for always being there for me. You mean so much to me; it's unbelievable that I have found someone as wonderful as you are. Even when I am down, you are always there for me and help bring me up again. Things have been so hectic lately that I could not have wanted anyone else to be there for me but you. You have been the stable force in my life, and this is just a note to let you know how much I love you.You are the sun, the moon, the whole universe to me. I love you for who you are and how you make me grow when I am with you. There has never been anyone else I can depend on when life gets tough except you. There are many times when you seem to feel what I'm feeling, even when it wasn't necessary, but I thank you for it, and now I know how important I am to you. In all the relationships that I've had before, there has never been one that turned out to be true love. There are so many things I could thank you for, but that would be impossible because there are so many I wouldn't know where to begin.I know that our love is true love. No one could ever replace you and, if anything happens to us, I don't know what I would do without you. You are my life and everything revolves around you. You hold my whole life in the palms of your hands. You always make the whole room light up just when you enter it, and you shine on me just like a star, but then you are a star, you are my angel.

"I was told that time heals all wounds and time just makes things a little easier to bear. But the truth is that I still cry myself to sleep thinking of you, I still dream of you. I get dressed every day and put my makeup on in case we see each other. I still look out the window, hoping you will drive up to the house. There are times, too, when I believe I must be crazy to want you back. You were not there for me many times.You have hurt me in countless ways, in ways you promised you never would.What has hurt me more than I ever had warning for was the night I called you from the accident scene. I was scared and I needed you. For a countless number of times, I was there when you needed me and it seemed fair that you would be there for me, too. As I waited on that hospital bed, I thought you would show up. But you didn't. You didn't even call for days. I have never felt so scared, lost, and alone as I did that night. I wish I knew why, I wish I could understand why you didn't come.Strange as it seems even to me, I still care for you. I do know, however, that I have to let go and that is what I am doing.",1

I have always asked myself why I love you, but I cannot answer. I won't let this love ruin our friendship, a friendship that we have shared for the past two years.I only wish that if the time comes when you will find out how much I love you, you won't hate me.

"Disappointing and unexpected circumstances demand that I submit my resignation from my position as Area Coordinator, effective immediately.I recently received word that my territories have been reassigned and that I must either transfer to a neighboring state or submit my resignation. Because my husband's current position is far more lucrative than mine, it is not financially prudent for me to transfer to another location. I wish to seek another position similar to this one immediately.Despite my disappointment, I want to thank you for the excellent training I have received while working at Doe Corporation. I have no doubt that the skills I have acquired will enable me to find other employment more in line with my career objectives.My files are in order and up to date.

You have won my heart and soul. You have won it all. You make me feel like I am in heaven--in the arms of an angel. You and I have a fulfilling relationship, but as it goes on, I wonder which is it--friends or lovers? That is not certain yet.

When you brush my cheek with your hand, I feel it all over me. With each step that you take and each word that you speak, my heart skips a beat.Every day, I vow to express these feelings to you, but every time I try and you look me in the eyes, my emotions become too strong, and I simply become speechless.

If they could ever hear us argue, some people would say that we are not going to make it because, well, we can get harsh, but they do not know us. Baby, nobody knows what I have had to do to get where I am. Nobody knows what you had to do to get where you are. Nobody knows us, except for us. Baby, nobody knows about the things in my past that I had to overcome to trust you. Nobody knows what you had to overcome. Nobody knows about how scared I was of you because of what one person did to me. So many people think that I am crazy for falling in love with you, but how can they judge someone that they do not know?It mystifies me how so many people can try to tell me what I need when they do not even know me. It hurts that the people who are supposed to know me try to take my happiness away.

"For ten years already, The Young Companions have been providing numerous forms of assistance to the elderly residents of our town. Some seniors need help with bills and correspondence. Other individuals yearn for a friendly and familiar face. Still other individuals suffer from failing vision and simply enjoy listening to a novel read aloud. Of course, many seniors still desire to get out and about but can't manage most excursions on their own. The members of The Young Companions understand and address these and many other needs.To top it all off, these services are provided voluntarily through the compassion and goodwill of our members. However, the group administration has always been committed to covering the expenses our members must pay to get from their homes to the seniors' places of residence. Some members take public transportation. Other members drive their own cars. In all cases, the administration desires to cover the cost of travel.Although these costs are not much, given the nonprofit status of The Young Companions, we depend on donations to provide compensation to our members. We are writing today, therefore, to ask for your support of our cause and of the wonderful commitment of our young members. We have enclosed a donation form and a prepaid envelope. Please take moment to consider supporting the valuable services provided by these young, committed individuals.The Young Companions greatly appreciates your understanding and support. ",0

"You once gave me your trust and honesty; I did what I wanted with it, including hurting you in many ways. You gave me your love and I stomped on it. Many years have past and I found my true self. And again you trusted me. Now is time for me to give you my trust and honesty.I see you in different eyes--I see you like never before. I see a father and a husband-to-be.

"This letter is to a man I thought I'd never know--the one who stole my heart so innocently, with care, with grace, and with quiet dignity.You are a man of few words who has seduced my heart and captured it in a way I never believed possible, in a way that steals my breath away and fills every quiet moment I have with thoughts of you.This feeling of love that I hold within my heart runs deeper than any ocean or sea. I love swimming in those deep blue waters of my heart with thoughts of you. I wish you could see how much you really mean to me. Perhaps if you look into my eyes, the window to my soul, then you would know that my heart is yours completely. If you listen to my heart beat, you can understand the language of love it speaks now. Listen to my heart closely--can you hear it? Can you hear it telling me to give you everything? I do so gladly. Try and taste my love for you in our next kiss. It's a love that is as pure and sweet as the finest candy that money could buy.My love is all I have to give to you, sealed with honesty, passion, trust, and compassion. This seems so little to offer someone I adore as much as you--so little to offer a man that has given me so much already.As time goes by, may this love I hold for you grow stronger and fulfill your every desire. I give you this fragile heart of mine and ask nothing less or more in return. If you want me to be your love as much as I want you to be mine--then I am yours.Please hear this as my declaration of love. I love you with all my heart, and I will never stop loving you. I trust you, respect you, and really want to please you. You are my life, you are my friend. You are the piece that was missing to a very complex puzzle. You will always be embedded deep within my heart. I adore you, and I am yours as long as you will have me. I give you all my love, from this moment on--throughout eternity.",1

I know in other people's eyes we weren't the best couple, but in my eyes we were.I miss everything about you, and I can never get you off my mind, no matter how hard I try. People keep on telling me to just let you go, but it's easier said than done. I just can't let you go.

Let my pen draw you closer to me, my angel, so that I can clearly picture you on this writing tablet as I write your name on it, over and over again.

"I have received the school's notice requiring students to attend school on Saturday to compensate for days missed earlier this winter due to inclement weather. I understand that the school administration must ensure that the students attend a given number of school days and that Saturdays may be the only option between this late date and the end of the school year. However, two days notice prior to the make-up day is unsatisfactory, particularly when this weekend is a three-day holiday weekend.I suggest you review your decision and either pick another Saturday or extend the school year one day. Our family, along with many others, has travel plans and our children will not attend this Saturday. It would be a pity if decisions such as this were to threaten the parents' support of the school. I feel sure that after the administration is aware of parents' concerns, they will reconsider this decision. ",0
"I love you! Three amazing little words! They say so much, yet cannot begin to convey the intricacy of my feelings--how you have captured my heart, and have become more and more each day a vital part of my life. These three wonderful little words cannot fully express how indelibly embedded in my mind you are, how I think of you constantly, reflecting on each conversation, and on each card and letter that we have shared.I love you! How can these words describe how much of a part of me you have become? How can they tell you that you are what has been missing from my life? How can they express how desperately I need you? How can they tell you of all the peace, joy, pleasure, and satisfaction that is now within my heart because of you?I love you! These three words seemingly cannot express all the things that are in my heart, mind, and soul. Yet, somehow, magically, they tell it all. I love you!",1

"Before I met you, my life was not going well at all. Then I met you, and I forgot all about my troubles.

The feelings I have for you are unexplainable. You mean the world to me. I would do nothing to hurt you.I know that I may not be the best girlfriend, but I'm learning, and I love you from the bottom of my heart.

"How are you, my dear, are you tired, are you ok? I always ask you lots of questions, not because I just am curious, but because every question comes from inside my heart. We are so far apart from each other, and I try so much to be with you. This is difficult, but nothing on earth can make me lose my true love for you.Although we've never met in person, I still truly love you. I don't really know when I first started to love you. Maybe it started with sending e-mails back and forth every day, opening with a ""good morning"" or ending with a ""good night"" with a lot of feeling. Then, one day, I found myself loving you and couldn't stop that feeling. Just knowing you more and more each day, and seeing how you understood everything I did, I started to love you more and more. Every time you say ""Hi,"" you brighten my life.Distance is a problem now, but if we look at it from a different point of view, we will know this is the thing that can only prove our true love, not end it. It won't be long before every dream will come true, and we will smile with a tear of happiness together. We'll talk about the past in our home together with our little daughter who you wanted to stay with me-the little girl who has black hair like you, blue eyes like me, and your smile.

"My angel, my all, my very self — only a few words today and at that with your pencil — not till tomorrow will my lodgings be definitely determined upon — what a useless waste of time. Why this deep sorrow where necessity speaks — can our love endure except through sacrifices — except through not demanding everything — can you change it that you are not wholly mine, I not wholly thine? Oh, God! look out into the beauties of nature and comfort yourself with that which must be — love demands everything and that very justly — that it is with me so far as you are concerned, and you with me. If we were wholly united you would feel the pain of it as little as I! Now a quick change to things internal from things external. We shall surely see each other; moreover, I cannot communicate to you the observations I have made during the last few days touching my own life — if our hearts were always close together I would make none of the kind. My heart is full of many things to say to you – Ah! — there are moments when I feel that speech is nothing after all — cheer up — remain my true, only treasure, my all as I am yours; the gods must send us the rest that which shall be best for us. Your faithful, Ludwig",1

"I love being with you, holding you, and looking into your eyes, just hoping you feel the same about me. I love you so much, words cannot fully express it. Every moment I spend with you is a moment I cherish. I grow deeper in love with you more and more every day, and I do not know what I would do without you now. I long for your hugs and kisses. Sometimes I like to think my love for you is like a great dream, because I don't ever want to wake up and lose that love.I have found both love and friendship with you. We are not just lovers, we are also friends, and that is what makes our relationship so special because the greatest lovers don't always make the best of friends. When you feel that times can't get any worse, I will try my best to always make things better to make you happy, and I will be by your side whenever you need me. I hope I am and always will be in your heart and in your dreams forever. I love you.",1
"I just heard about your retirement plans, John. It sure will be dull around this greenhouse without you. You know, of course, that you are our source of community information. After landscaping more than half the yards in Springfield, you seem to know everyone and everything. We will miss you.Now you and Jane can hop in that motor home and head for Miami, but I know you'll be back. A man with a thumb as green as yours can't leave it stuck in that lifeless, Floridian sand for long. Come by and see my gorgeous chrysanthemums when you get home. Best wishes. ",0

"There was a time when I thought dreams were enough for a broken heart. I guess I was wrong. The stars in the sky lost all their meaning. At times I feel the need to cry, and the night can't hide my tears. I try to hold onto our memories, but that's not enough to fill the void in my heart. I'm over you, at least I keep telling myself that, but it's not true, I still love you.",1
I don't know when I have been more affected by a sermon than I was this last Sunday. You touched on some points that hit pretty close to home. I was so glad you seemed to notice and took the time to talk to me after the service. Your kind words settled my heart and gave me very real hope. It is wonderful to leave a church service feeling uplifted and full of hope. I look forward to Sundays now more than ever before. Thank you for your unselfish service. ,0
"We rarely see each other or spend any time together anymore. Things seem changed. What has gone wrong? Do you want me to be in your future? Will you give this relationship the attention it deserves? How can a relationship survive if there is only one person doing the work of two? We are close only when we make love, but even that side of the relationship is suffering now.I'm not sure I can go on anymore the way things have been. I will let you go if I have to move on because we each deserve to be with someone who truly loves us.I do, however, want to give us one more try and if you too want to try, let's talk.",1
"Every day, every moment that goes by I think of you. My brain tells me to give up, but my heart says I can't stop loving you. I spend all day dreaming of the moment you would call to say you feel the same way. As much as I try to pretend, the truth is, I can't stop loving you. I don't know how to stop.I will cherish the moments we have spent together, from our very first kiss to our last. I miss the way you kissed me, the way you looked at me and rubbed my face. I miss you calling me ""Ms. Maynard"" (because you know it gets on my nerves). I miss you missing me, I miss everything about you. I miss our phone conversations, and the way we would spend hours talking about our native countries, and the different ways we grew up. But most of all, I miss my best friend.I will place the moments we've shared together in a time capsule and hide it in the most secret place of my heart. And maybe 20 years from now, if or when we meet again, maybe then we can both open the capsule together and be reminded of our wonderful friendship.Gosh, my life is miserable! I finally met the right guy (you), but he's not available. I'm in love with you, but we can't be together. I've got to tell you, though, for the first time in months, I can finally smile because, although you didn't say much the last time you called, I could tell you still cared.You can keep on denying it, you can keep hiding from it, but you are only lying to yourself. Every day I ask myself, ""Why, why do I feel this way? Why can't I stop loving you?"" Then it dawned on me--you've put a spell on me! Just kidding.Before I go, I want you to know that you will always have a special place in my heart and, like I've said many times before, I do not regret anything we've done. The only thing I regret is you telling me you love me, because since then you have given me nothing but the cold shoulder.Please don't be scared, I want nothing but your friendship, well--I do want more, but I am willing to settle for less. I am not trying to make you feel bad or push you further away. I am just trying to make you understand what's in my heart.I love you with all my heart, and I will always love you.",1

"I don't think there are any words strong enough to explain how I feel about you. I know saying, ""I love you,"" is very powerful, yet I feel it's not enough. You are everything to me because I see you in books, songs, poems, television and everything else. Some people compare loved ones with the sun, moon, and stars, but to me you can't compare to any of that because you're so much more than those things or anything else. When I say that you're everything, I mean, you're the air that I breathe, the light in my life, the reason I get up every morning. If it wasn't for you, that smile you see on my face every day and the glow I have in my cheeks wouldn't be there anymore. You truly are my life and there is no one I would rather spend my life with than you. I love you more than words could ever express.",1

"I know that I'm not perfect, but I know that I don't want to give you up. I have waited too long to hold you in my arms. I know that we belong together. I love you a lot, and I know that you know that. I guess I just need to vent and let you know how I feel. Please don't take my venting the wrong way. I do love you and don't want to break up with you. That would just make me even more imperfect than I already am.",1

I cannot tell you what pleasure this gave me, because I always feel so overwhelmingly in your debt, if there can be accounts in love…. What it has been to me to live all these years in your heart and companionship no phrases can convey. Time passes swiftly, but is it not joyous to see how great and growing is the treasure we have gathered together, amid the storms and stresses of so many eventful and to millions tragic and terrible years?

"Never in my wildest dreams did I ever believe this could ever happen. I never expected to fall so deeply in love so fast. It all started last week with your first email to me: ""Call me, we need to talk!"" I was just online trying to catch up with some friends, and I had the pleasure of seeing your email message in my mailbox. I wanted to wait a few days before calling you, but my heart had other plans. So I called you a few hours later and that was the beginning of this love affair to remember.I remember we talked for hours about anything and everything. When you asked me to come to NYC to visit, I was scared at first, but again my heart spoke for me. I decided to take a chance and see what would happen, but I never expected we would say we loved each other even before we met in person. Now don't get me wrong--I believe in love at first sight, but I thought I would be the last person to be bitten by that bug. When you surprised me with a dozen long-stemmed roses last Wednesday, however, I received a confirmation that had been in my heart since Sunday--that I loved you. When you said, ""I love you,"" it gave me a little tingle in the pit of my stomach. Something I had never felt before.When we saw each other Thursday night for the first time, I knew you were real and not just a dream that I hoped would come true. The time we spent together in NYC was magical and so romantic that I never wanted it to end. When you asked me to move to NYC, how could I say, ""No""? When you said you wanted me to be your wife, how could I say, ""no""? Even though we live apart right now, I have faith that in due time this will all come to an end, and we will be together forever. I love you more than words could ever show, and I know you love me too. Like the saying goes, ""Distance makes the heart grow fonder."" Well, my heart has always been and will continue to be quite fond of you. I love you more today than yesterday, and I will love you more tomorrow than I do today!",1
No matter what has happened. No matter what you've done. No matter what you will do. I will always love you.,1

In your 23 years here you have been a mentor to all of us. You have taken this department to the leading edge of the industry, which is the kind of record any company should envy. Even more important though are the friendships you have developed over that time. We will all miss you very much. ",0

"Thanks for your input during last Thursday's unit meeting. As your overtime hours have increased, we too have come to realize the unreasonable scope of your present job description. After adding six typesetting projects a month to your regular editing workload, we have decided to hire an assistant unit manager to relieve you of several administrative tasks.While this assistant will alleviate much of your burden, we still plan to increase the number of monthly typesetting projects in your unit from 12 to 18. This increase, however, will occur only incrementally, and additional personnel will be assigned to your unit to help handle the load. Specifically, we plan to transfer two editors from Eric Doe's unit to yours. You will be responsible for training them as part-time typesetters over the next three months. If you can have them up to speed by May, we will then begin expanding to eighteen projects a month.We will need your continued feedback during this transition phase and expect to consult with you frequently. Above all, we are eager to see your daily workload confined to a manageable number of hours. With an assistant, this should begin to happen immediately. ",0
"You are my dream come true, my soul mate, my angel sent from above. I never thought it was possible to love someone the way I love you, but that was before I met you. We met differently than other couples--we met online. I didn't get to hold you, feel you, caress your silky skin, touch your lips, but I carried you with me all day long in my heart. My love for you grows more and more with every day that goes by. You know that I love you more than anything; that's why I don't understand why you ask me if I love you, or how do I love you? You don't need to have doubts because my love for you is real and always will be. If I stay quiet and don't say anything when you ask me that, it's not because I don't want to answer or don't know what to say, it's because there isn't anything that can describe my love for you. There isn't anything as amazing as you are, Honey. I will love you today, tomorrow, and FOREVER!",1
"It's been a long time since we've spoken or even seen each other. When we were together, it felt so right. I miss the way you would hold me. I wish you knew how much you meant to me.

When I was deserted and thought that the world had come to an end, you stood by me through all the rough and difficult times. You made me understand that life is all about appreciation and understanding, but must be appreciated first before there can be understanding, and neither can exist without having experienced love first.I want to make this promise to you, based on the love that you have shown me, and the things you have done to teach me again what hope means. I declare my love for you alone, no one but you, and that is from the bottom of my heart.

"When my sky turns gray, and the thunder starts to roll, and it seems as if tomorrow will never come, I turn to you. The look in your eyes, the touch of your hands, the sound of your voice--it's all I need to brighten my day and blow the rainy clouds away. You are my angel from above, sent to me. Why? I do not know, but what I do know is that I don't deserve it. When I look into your eyes and feel your gentle touch, it sends chills up my spine, sending me into an ecstasy beyond explanation.Babe, you drive me wild! Just the way you look in my eyes sends my head spinning and the stars start to shine. The sound of your voice starts my heart pumping so, Babe, you can only imagine what it's like when you wrap your arms around me and I feel your warm breath on my cheek. You make my body shiver in bliss, my breath is taken away, I see the stars, Babe, and it's all because of you. It's amazing how you knock me off my feet; every time you come around me, I get weak.Dream maker, make my dreams come true tonight! If I close my eyes, will you hold me tight all night? Will you be here by my side when my nights are cold and lonely? Will you give me your love that I crave so deeply? I cannot imagine my life without you now. You are everything inside me that I wish I could be and so much more. I look at my life before I knew your love, and I don't know how I ever survived.As I said before, you are my angel, my miracle. I never knew that someone like you was out there, just waiting for me to find her. Well, I did find you, Babe, and now that I have you, I will never let you go!Babe, just confide in me your deepest feelings, tell me your fantasies, and they shall all be fulfilled. I will do anything it takes to make you happy because that is the only thing that matters to me anymore. You are perfect in my eyes, and there is absolutely nothing that I would ever change about you. I know that no one can be perfect but you, Babe, in my eyes, are as perfect as anyone could be. It leaves me amazed, yet blessed, to have found someone as special as you are.Babe, I'm going to be sitting here waiting; waiting for your phone call and then waiting for the day I will actually see you. A little distance between us is going to drive me crazy, but I know it'll all work out just fine. Till then, I will just be waiting for the day when we will actually be together.I love you.Hugs, misses, and butterfly kisses,",1

I love you and I need you.",1
"My dear Friend, Yes, I have told you, and repeat it: I love you dearly. You certainly said the same thing to me, I begin to know the world. I will tell you what I suggest, now: pay attention. I don’t want to remain a shopgirl, but a little more my own mistress, and would therefore like to find someone to keep me. If I did not love you, I would try to get money from you; I would say to you, you shall begin by renting me a room and furnishing it; only as you told me that you are not rich, you can take me to your own place. It will not cost you anymore rent, nor more for your table and the rest of your housekeeping. To keep me and my headdress will be the only expense, and for those give me one hundred livres a month, and that will include everything. Thus we could both live happily, and you would never again have to complain about my refusal. If you love me, accept this proposal; but if you do not love me, then let each of us try his luck elsewhere. Good-by, I embrace you heartily, Jeanne Rancon",1

"It is with mixed emotions that I announce the retirement of Jane Doe, our department secretary. She has provided us with 37 years of devoted service. I don't know how we will get along without her!Jane's attention to detail, while keeping the broader picture in mind, has been invaluable. Her willingness to put in extra time and effort to help us meet deadlines has demonstrated a commitment to excellence that we have come to depend upon. I personally owe her a debt of gratitude for all the times she has helped keep me on track, on time, and within our budget. In addition to her incredible competence and skill, she has been a friend to all with her thoughtfulness and quiet encouragement.I invite you to join me in showing Jane our tremendous appreciation at a retirement luncheon that will be held in the staff lounge on her last day of work, Friday, June 30. We invite everyone to attend and share your memories of working with Jane, and to wish her a wonderful retirement. ",0
"Thank you for your suggestion that we enlarge the women's rest rooms. We requested remodeling estimates and were disappointed to learn that a major renovation costing over $90,000 would be needed.

Thanks for caring enough to submit your suggestion. ",0

Finding someone to fill your shoes will be no easy task. Nevertheless, I wish you all the best in your future endeavors. You deserve it. ",0
"Yes, Marquis, I will keep my word with you, and upon all occasions shall speak the truth, though I sometimes tell it at my own expense. I have more firmness of mind than perhaps you may imagine, and ’tis very probable that in the course of this correspondence, you will think I push this quality too far, even to severity. But then, please to remember that I have only the outside of a woman, and that my heart and mind are wholly masculine…. Shall I tell you what makes love so dangerous? ‘Tis the too high idea we are apt to form it. But to speak the truth, love, considered as passion, is merely a blind instinct, that we should rate accordingly. It is an appetite, which inclines us to one object, rather than another, without our being able to account for our taste. Considered as a bond of friendship, where reason presides, it is no longer a passion and loses the very name of love. It becomes esteem: which is indeed a very pleasing appetite, but too tranquil; and therefore incapable of rousing you from you present supineness. If you madly trace the footsteps of our ancient heroes of romance, adopting their extravagant sentiments, you will soon experience, that such false chivalry metamorphoses this charming passion into a melancholy folly; nay, often a tragical one: a perfect frenzy! but divest it of all the borrowed pomp and opinion, and you will then perceive how much it will contribute both to your happiness and pleasure. Be assured that if either reason or knight errantry should be permitted to form the union of our hearts, love would become a state of apathy and madness. The only way to avoid these extremes, is to pursue the course I pointed out to you. At present you have no occasion for any thing more than mere amusement, and believe me, you will not meet it except among women of the character I speak of. Your heart wants occupation; and they are framed to supply the void. At least, give my prescription a fair trial, and I will be answerable for the success. I promised to reason with you, and I think I have kept my word. Farewell...",1

"I am really honored you chose to come to me with your question. I have been thinking about you and Jane for a few weeks now. From where I stand it seems as though you two have come to an impasse. I can only recommend you spend some time apart. Often separation provides the perspective needed to know in which direction to proceed. You may not know this, but Suzanne and I separated briefly several years ago. She stayed with her parents for a few weeks. It really renewed our appreciation for one another. Time apart may not be the solution for you two. I can only tell you about our experience. Whatever route you take, I hope you will be able to work things out. You will always have my support. ",0

At the distance we are from each other every fear will obtrude itself on my mind. Let me hope that you are not really worse than your kindness, your affection, for me make you say…I think…that no more molestation will arise to the recovery of your health, which I pray for beyond every other blessing under heaven. Let us…think only of the blessings that providence may yet have in store for us and that we may yet possess. I am happy in love–an affection exceeding a thousand times my deserts, which has continued so many years, and is yet undiminished…Never will I marry in this world if I marry not you. Truly can I say that for the seven years since I avowed my love for you, I have…foregone all company, and the society of all females (except my own relations) for your sake. I am still ready to make my sacrifice for you…I will submit to any thing you may command me–but cease to respect, to love and adore you I never can or will. I must still think that we should have married long ago–we should have had many troubles–but we have yet had no joys, and we could not have starved…Your FRIENDS have never been without a hope of parting us and see what that has cost us both–but no more. Believe me, my beloved & ever dearest Maria, most faithfully yours, John",1

It is clear to me that she is the best qualified candidate. She is articulate and has a good reputation as a team worker and producer.

"A few years ago, I had totally given up on love. I thought that nobody was out there for me. I thought that the ache in my heart would forever go unfulfilled. I even began to think that love itself might be an illusion. But then you entered my life and, suddenly, love was real. It was a fact, and it was everywhere. After only a short time, my heart finally felt whole, and I knew you were the cause. You were the answer I had been looking for deep inside. I knew, without a doubt, that you were the only one for me.Thank you for entering my life. You have brought me such joy. I will love you for the rest of my days!",1
"I don't know how to tell you my feelings personally, so I will try here. I only have three months left before you leave for the service. That is all I can think about.You mean the world to me and much more. Without you, life is all just a bore. I cry so many nights just thinking about you, and the life together we will have one day. But now I worry and ask if our love is strong enough. With every guy, I saw something in them I loved, yet they never had quite all of it, but you do, Baby, all I have to give! My mother told me, when I asked her how will I know if I've found the right one, she replied, ""You will know, you will feel it deep in the core of your soul,"" and I never believed her until the day you walked into my life. I have known that I loved you and really cared about you but didn't realized my love was this strong until you got on one knee and proposed to me. I fell down crying after you left. It was the happiest day of my life and I will never regret saying, ""Yes.""Without you, my life wouldn't be whole. There would be no sunshine and definitely no one to come to my house at 5:00 a.m. in the morning just because they missed me. I love you so very much, Baby, and this all seems like a fairy tale, but one thing about this is that it is real, and I love you with all my heart because without you, I don't know what I would do.So, please understand how much I love you and why I cry even when you make me happy sometimes. And when I get mad at some of the things you do, most of the time it is just because I love you so very much and don't ever want to lose you.",1

"It's been a long time since we've talked, and I miss you. I miss that summer and everything we had. I know I acted silly when we were going out, but maybe you did a little, too. If I could turn back time, I would make things better. I heard people say some things, and I let them influence me. I wasn't mature enough to talk things out with you. Instead, I acted like a little girl by ignoring you when you tried to talk to me. I'm sorry for hurting you. Now I want you back in my life because I need a friend like you again.I don't know how you feel. I know my feelings for you are still the same, and my memories haven't faded.Now I realize that you don't ever know what you've got till you lose it. I lost you and I regret it.

Loving you is the greatest gift I have in life. Thank you for giving me your love and respect. I love you!",1

"Every day more and more American families juggle the demands of work with their family commitments. Unfortunately, in family after family, it is the woman who bears the major burden of both responsibilities. Recently, a mother of two young boys, while describing how she was balancing her job with caring for her children had this to say:""It's like a house of cards. Right now it is standing, but I feel like the slightest breath of wind or the smallest breeze could knock down a wall, a room, or the whole structure.""In one out of 15 families, a woman is the only adult parent in the home. In one out of 5 single-parent families, mothers with toddlers or school-age children also work outside the home. Here at the Working Mothers' Center, we help them in very real ways.Counselors in our pre-school program, Leap Frog, organize small children into peer groups and provide them with close supervision and fun learning activities while their mothers are at work. Our after-school program, The Second Mile, provides trained counselors and teachers who help older children with their homework and supervise learning-oriented activities until their mothers are free to pick them up.The Working Mothers' Center has become a powerful force for good in our area and encourages growing children to avoid trouble and succeed in school, thereby preparing them to join the work force as they become young adults. City-wide drug use, petty theft, vandalism, and other juvenile crimes have declined in every one of the five years that our center has been open. At the beginning of this school year, we also had a 25% increase in the number of parents who wanted us to accept their children into our programs.Up until now, we have been able to respond to these requests, but now we are reaching the limits of our financial budget. That is why I am writing to you--we need your help. I believe you are the type of person who would be willing to share the blessings of your own success with this very worthwhile community project.We are asking for donations of $25 or $50 (or more if you are able), to support our efforts to help working mothers and their children. Would you please make out your check to ""Working Mothers' Center"" and mail it in the enclosed stamped envelope? A lot of children who need our help would be grateful if you could send us your tax-deductible donation today.Our center has proven itself to be a valuable asset to the community. Helping us now will strengthen the rising generation of children and prepare them to become responsible citizens in the years to come.We are sincerely grateful for your support!P.S. We would be happy to take you on a tour of our center so you can meet our capable staff and watch them interact with the busy, happy children entrusted to our care.

"Michael will see his dad today--and he's terrified. This little boy is only seven and he hasn't seen his dad in over a year, but he remembers that he had a terrible temper.Michael's parents were divorced two years ago after bitter fighting. Afterwards, he lived with his mom, and his dad just visited him on weekends. Then his mother told his dad he wasn't welcome anymore because they always ended up in an argument. After that, Michael's mom remarried and he found himself with a stepfather and a new last name. Understandably, this little boy is confused and not doing well in school. He needs your help.His real dad wants to see him again and is suing his mother for custody. She realized that she couldn't handle the situation by herself, so she agreed to let him visit Michael at the Family Services Center. It has a room with a pleasant, home-like atmosphere where Michael can feel secure while he and his dad get to know each other again under the supervision of a trained counselor.Many families turn to Family Services for help when their marriages are troubled or end in divorce, or when their children become psychologically damaged by custody cases, conflict, and abuse. I know you would agree that the American family faces more challenges today than ever to stay together and remain stable. Won't you join me in making sure that our center remains financially able to help every troubled family who turns to us for assistance?During these difficult economic times, the demand for our services has exploded. In just the past six months, the number of people seeking counseling at our center has increased 40% over the previous year.

Yes, my adorable mistress, to-night I shall see you, and if I had to put my head on the block to do it. For heaven’s sake, do not speak to me in such disastrous terms as you write; you must live and be cautious; beware of madame your mother as of your worst enemy. What do I say? Beware of everybody; trust no one; keep yourself in readiness, as soon as the moon is visible; I shall leave the hotel incognito, take a carriage or a chaise, we shall drive like the wind to Sheveningen; I shall take paper and ink with me; we shall write our letters. If you love me, reassure yourself; and call all your strength and presence of mind to your aid; do not let your mother notice anything, try to have your pictures, and be assured that the menace of the greatest tortures will not prevent me to serve you. No, nothing has the power to part me from you; our love is based upon virtue, and will last as long as our lives. Adieu, there is nothing that I will not brave for your sake; you deserve much more than that. Adieu, my dear heart!",1

You are irresistible to me, and I don't know how anyone could be dumb enough to let you go. I know I never will again.I didn't used to be romantic, but you taught me how to be. You have taught me so much, and I admire your wisdom. The thing I love most about you is how you can change my mood from sad to happy, just with a little conversation.

You have fulfilled all my ambition, realized all my hopes, made all my dreams come true. You have set a crown of roses on my youth and fortified me against the disaster of our days.  Your courageous gaiety has inspired me with joy.  Your tender faithfulness has been a rock of security and comfort.  I have felt for you all kinds of love at once.

Will you write something to me? I hope you will. How am I to sign myself? I won’t sign anything at all, because I don’t know what to sign myself.",1

"My dearest Teresa, I have read this book in your garden;–my love, you were absent, or else I could not have read it. It is a favourite book of yours, and the writer was a friend of mine. You will not understand these English words, and others will not understand them,–which is the reason I have not scrawled them in Italian. But you will recognize the handwriting of him who passionately loved you, and you will divine that, over a book which was yours, he could only think of love. In that word, beautiful in all languages, but most so in yours–Amor mio–is comprised my existence here and hereafter. I feel I exist here, and I feel I shall exist hereafter,–to what purpose you will decide; my destiny rests with you, and you are a woman, eighteen years of age, and two out of a convent. I love you, and you love me,–at least, you say so, and act as if you did so, which last is a great consolation in all events. But I more than love you, and cannot cease to love you. Think of me, sometimes, when the Alps and ocean divide us, –but they never will, unless you wish it.",1

"I am sitting in my room in front of the monitor, with the keyboard in front of me waiting to see your nickname on the screen. I feel you so near and yet so distant at the same moment. Every day I find something new in you, something that makes me feel different but sure about one thing--you are not only my friend, but you are something more, something deeper. Do you feel the same way?I remember the day when I decided that I couldn't hide my feelings from you anymore. I wrote and told you what I feel. You were glad that I expressed my feelings, and you said that you cared about me, too. I was hoping these unexpected feelings would blossom into love. I wanted a deep love that bonds two people together, but I found that we had a different kind of love that was strong in its own way. We were concerned about one another's happiness, but we did not feel that our happiness depended on what we felt for one another. We found friendship and a peaceful love that moved smoothly, but did not become passion.I knew then that we each had found a friend, and that was enough for both of us now. We both agreed that our friendship could someday become more, but we agreed to take our relationship one day at a time. We knew that we would care about one another for a long time. Our friendship would continue, and you would be here for me, and I would be here for you. I would enjoy hearing from you soon and hear what's going on in your life. A few interesting things have happened on my end that I want to tell you about, too.",1

Do you know what it is like when the one you love so deeply and dearly is so far away? Your heart cries out their name and yet there is no reply.All you want to do is hold them in your arms, and you cannot. All you desire to do is kiss their sweet lips, and you cannot. You long to hear their soft sweet voice as they whisper words of love to you, and you cannot. You just want them near, and they are not.Their absence brings with it frustration and sadness. You question God that you cannot be with the one you love, and yet you thank Him completely for bringing that person into your life, all the while knowing that no amount of dreams or hopes or prayers can change the situation-the situation that is in the hands of the God you trust.So, what do you do in such times? How do you keep your wits about you? How do you maintain some semblance of normal life, when all you can do is think about the person that you are so much in love with and who you would do or give anything just to be with? You feel lost somewhere between the cruel reality of life, and the dream-like fairytale that you wish to live in, and the only salvation is to be found in the arms of your beloved and that cannot happen.Friends cannot comfort your soul. Thoughts only make your heartache worse. What do you do? You pray to God for the strength to see you through this situation, knowing that you will never fully be the person you were before when your love was here.The mind is a whirlwind as your thoughts are tossed around like leaves in the wind. But the one thought that is constant and eats away at the core of your soul is a simple one: ""When will I hear from you again? Will I ever hear from you again?"" Time causes such thoughts to occur, over and over. It is only human. I am only human.And so, I wait. For how long? Only time can tell. As I wait, it seems as though the hands of the clock move in reverse instead of forward. Each second that passes seems an eternity away from you. Time takes you further away from me instead of bringing you closer, and time is something that is beyond our control.Oh, to be an angel, and have wings that I may fly into your arms at this very second! To taste your sweet kiss and feel your warm embrace. To love you, to have the pain of needing you, all vanish in your arms, as would snowflakes on a summer day. And to know that we would at last be together for all our days. Days spent lost in sweet heavenly love, such as we have never known.My darling, how is it that love can be so wonderful, and yet hurt so badly? Such pleasure in knowing and feeling your love for me, and such mortal pain in being apart from the one that I love so deeply, so dearly, so passionately.Darling, you know the old saying that applies to being away from someone important that goes: ""Out of sight, out of mind""? But, my love, every ""old saying"" has an opposite maxim. This one is: ""Absence makes the heart grow fonder."" Just when I think it is not possible to be more in love with you, I discover that I am more in love with you than ever before.Good night, my love. And never doubt that with each breath that I take, I love you more. I love you.",1
"When I first saw you, I knew something was different about you. I wanted to talk to you for a long time, but I did not have the courage to talk to you at all. I thank God every day that He brought you into my life.I had no idea that things would end up the way they are now. I could never have guessed that you would be my wife, and I would not change anything about us. I love you with all my heart and soul. You fill me with so much happiness. When I go off every day to work, there is only one thing that keeps me going from day to day, and that is the assurance I will be able to spend time with you when I come home. Knowing I will be able to spend the rest of my life with you fills me with so much joy that tears come to my eyes. I smile every time I hear your voice. You mean the world to me, and I never want to lose you. I love you.",1

"No one in this world knows the feeling that I get when I see you. They have no idea what I feel when I hear your name or your soft voice. Nobody has ever made me feel the way you make me feel, and that is such a crazy feeling. All I know is that I want to grab you and be in your arms forever and forever and never let go. I want to kiss your lips and never stop--just keep on going.Every time I think about you, it gives me more strength to carry on my life. It makes me happy to be alive, knowing that you've come into my life. All I know is that I want to be with you! And I hope that you, too, want always to be with me.",1

Although we've had some disagreements and fights lately, I want you to know that I still need to hear your voice.

It's true we sometimes say things to hurt each other, but I want you to know that I love you with all my heart. These times have been hard lately, but let's remember all the good things we have had, and the wonderful times we can yet have together.",1

"No words can perfectly describe my feelings for you. Thank you for being such a wonderful partner. I can't imagine living my life without you near me now. In our situation, it's much easier to give up, but still we both hang on, risking everything just to prove we can make it. Thanks for loving me and trying to set the better side of me free.I love you so much, too much, sometimes. Now and then I wonder if you cast a spell on me just so I would fall madly in love with you! I wonder if we even share the same dreams, but time alone can tell. I am looking forward to being with you for the rest of my life.",1

"When have you, or someone you love, last ridden in an ambulance? Never, I hope. But if you have needed an ambulance, I'm glad it was there for you. If any of us ever need an ambulance in the future, I'm sure we would all like it to be up-to-date, with all the equipment needed to save lives and stabilize patients on their way to the Emergency Room.I am one of Springfield city's emergency medical technicians (EMTs). We undergo ongoing training to make sure that we are able to meet the needs of the people we serve. We are all volunteers and are glad to be able to help people when they are in trouble, but we do need your help.Currently, our city needs a new ambulance and new equipment for its two existing ambulances. Those few minutes before we reach the emergency room can make the difference between life and death, and we want to give the very best care we can. With this new equipment, we can offer world-class emergency care for our patients.Will you help? We would appreciate your donation of $25, or whatever you feel you can afford. Most donations should be tax deductible.Please make your check payable to the Springfield Hospital Foundation Ambulance Fund. I have enclosed an envelope for your convenience. ",0
"What happened to us? The promise we made five years ago to say ""I love you"" every day, no matter what? I know I have shut you out in many ways, and that is only because of the distant and matter-of-fact attitude I sensed coming from you. I wish I could stop loving you, as you apparently have stopped loving me, but I have never lied to you and I won't start now.It was and always will be a special moment for me when you walked into my life. Like a prince, you turned my world into a fairytale of love and passion unknown to mankind before. I believed you when you told me we would always, ""If nothing else, let's be best friends."" Have you changed your mind?I realize you may never read this. I can only hope, as you used to tell me that this message, like a bottle at sea, will find its way to you and let you know that I will always love you, no matter what, and that these memories will never fade from within my soul. ""Soul mates,"" you said. If you believe that, then you don't need these words to know what I am feeling. Love hurts, and I know we have those circumstances in our lives that have kept us apart, but now I believe that if they weren't there, if it were just the two of us, we would still be where we are right now--a thousand miles from nowhere.I love you and I miss you. I don't know how to stop the pain of losing both a best friend and my first love. Be happy, my darling, and I will always wish upon a star that someday you will walk back into my life as you did once before.",1

I beg you to let me have the letter I ask. I am dying. Farewell.",1

"Many years and many miles have kept us apart for so long that it is hard to believe we have found each other again. Now we must make time disappear and miles grow shorter.

You give me strength when I can't carry on. You make me smile and laugh a lot, and I truly treasure that.I apologize straight from my heart for ignoring you and being rude to you, even when you make an attempt to make me feel better. You are a very patient man, and I thank you for that. I don't ever want to take advantage of your patience, not ever. I know I over-react a lot, and I'm sorry for my part in the quarrels.You are the most wonderful thing that has EVER happened to me. Until now, I never thought I would find a love that is as strong as yours. But now that we've found each other, I've changed my mind. You are the person I want to marry. Together we can raise children, and we can spend the rest of our lives together. Baby, you complete me. You make my life so brilliant that I don't know how else to repay you but to love, care, and support you more and more as time goes by. You're the one and only star in my sky. You make me feel very beautiful. Thank you for giving me so much.I can't imagine what it would be like if we were to lose each other. I don't even want to think of it, Baby.

"First, I would like to thank you for one of the best nights of my life. I can't even describe how you made me feel last night, it was so amazing. You have no idea how much you touched my heart and my soul then. I know that you are the only one for me, and the look in your eyes told me that I am the only one for you, too.From the first day we met, I knew that you were the only person I could see myself grow old with. I've always dreamed of finding that one person and now that I have, I don't know how I could live without you. You are the first thing I think about when I wake up, and the last thing I think about when I go to sleep. You're on my mind 24/7; you're even in my dreams. My love for you will only grow stronger as the years go by.I promise you that I will always be there for you. I will always do anything that I possibly can for you. I will make you happy when you're sad, I will take care of you when you're sick, and I will stand by your side until the end of time.I can't find the words to tell you how much I love you, but I know as the years go by you'll know just how much I care. I love you now and will forever.",1
"I need to make a claim on my insurance policy #1234. As I mentioned in my phone call last Friday, my mountain bike was stolen last Thursday night from outside the Springfield Public Library. The bike was locked to a bicycle rack. I reported the theft to the Springfield police as soon as I noticed that the bike was missing, but they have not been able to locate it.I bought the bike new for $695, and had had it for only three months. The helmet was an additional $35. I no longer have the receipt for the helmet, but have enclosed a copy of the receipt for the bike. Please pay my claim as soon as possible, as I rely on the bike for transportation to work. I am aware of my policy's $250 deductible. ",0

"I don't know what it is about you that makes me feel the way I do. No other guy can touch my heart, but you can see through to the depths of my very soul. I care about you more than I ever knew I could care about anyone before. You see, I never thought I could love again, but now I'm so confused. My heart says, ""yes,"" but my head says, ""no."" You wonder why I care about you, but it's simple: when I look into your eyes, I see beyond all the hostility on the outside. I see a real person with real needs, the one you are afraid to be. But that's okay, because I know the truth, and I will wait for the day when you'll open the gate and let me in. Even if it takes years, I'll be right here, waiting for you to let me love you, as I already love you now.",1

"Life is always full of surprises! Twists, turns, new opportunities. Just over five years ago, I joined City Insurance. I thought I would be there for a long time.

"We were pleased to receive your request for our classic, windowless model of BreadMax, the most popular bread-making machine on the market. BreadMax's simplicity and large loaf size, combined with our famous service contract, have given us a reputation to be proud of--a reputation made only brighter by the recent success of BreadMax II.With its fogless window, BreadMax II has been so favorably received that manufacture of the model you ordered--the original BreadMax--has been discontinued. While we're sorry for the inconvenience this may possibly cause you, we've found that virtually all our customers ordering by phone, when told of our recent change, have gladly opted for BreadMax II. They consider the additional $1.75 a small price to pay for the useful window feature. BreadMax II is essentially identical to our original model, differing only in its new window and a new latch design for improved insulation.Upon your request, we will immediately process your order, substituting Bread Max II for the unavailable model. We invite you to call us any time toll-free at 555-5555 or return the enclosed verification card at your earliest convenience. Alternately, we would be happy to offer you a complete refund. We value you as a customer and look forward to hearing from you. ",0
"During the last three months, five homes in our area have been burglarized. As you can imagine, we are very concerned about this trend and hope you will help us. All of the burglaries have occurred on weekend nights when many of us attend high school ball games or other community activities. It is clear that someone is targeting this neighborhood at specific times.Several of us have met to organize a neighborhood watch program, but we feel we need more help that we can muster alone. We think that increasing police patrols at these vulnerable times and having volunteers remain in the neighborhood on some nights might help. In any case, we need to learn how to protect our homes better.We would like to schedule a neighborhood meeting during which you or your representative could discuss what action should be taken. Most of the families could be represented on any weekday evening. Could you please let us know if this is possible? Thank you. ",0
"We first started chatting online, as buddies do, almost two years ago. You were there for me when I needed a friend to confide in and for support when my sister was ill. We met for the first time last June. I can still see you sitting on the wall outside the motel I was staying in. I knew then that I was falling in love with you, and my love for you has gotten stronger each passing day. I can't wait for the day when we can be together forever. You are my love, my life, my friend! Without you, I would only be half the person that I am. You make my world complete.You Are My SunshineMy dearest, life can be cruel, but when all the goodness comes together there is no moment as sweet. That is how I feel about you entering my life. You have rekindled the hope called love in me. You have given me one more reason to look forward to tomorrow.Now you are a significant part of my life and I look forward to the day when we can make it permanent. I love you so much. I love you for your kindness, for your caring and giving nature, for your beauty--both inner and outer. Most of all, though, I love you just because you are you. The fact that you show me who you really are, and not what you think I may want.Sweetie, let this letter be a testament to my true feelings for you.

"Sometimes I can't express to you the way I really feel inside. There are times I want to write poetry or sing a song, but they would just say some of what my heart wants to tell you. I sat down behind my desk at work today and decided to write you a letter. I am just a small town girl whose life is very different from yours, because you are in a state miles away, but I know our love will conquer all.You tell me to believe in our love and allow it to grow, but sometimes it's so hard when you have so many doubts. You live in a city where the most beautiful women live, and I am just one woman hundreds of miles away. It saddens my heart and sometimes I cry because I want to be with you, and I don't know what to say or how to tell you what hurts me so deep inside. I know you are successful, and I am so proud of you for who you are, Sweetheart. But, like you, I will try and believe that our love will conquer all.I wrote you this letter to tell you how much I care and, if you ever need me, Baby, please know I'll be there. I may not be the most beautiful woman in the world, but my heart is filled with gold. I know our friendship will continue to grow stronger, and we will conquer all obstacles placed between us. You make me feel so special, and it overwhelms my heart to know there is a man who thinks highly of me. All I ask of you is please, take it slow, and let's grow together in love, unity, and respect. Miles separate us and our cultures are different, too, but we have fun together and we share similar interests. So, Sweetheart, I will try harder and never give up, because I pray our love will conquer all.",1

"Dear First Lady I know tradition has it that on this morning I place cards   Happy Anniversary cards on your breakfast tray.  But things are  somewhat mixed up.  I substituted a gift & delivered it a few weeks ago. Still this is the day, the day that marks 31 years of such happiness as comes to few men.  I told you once that it was like an  adolescent’s dream of what marriage should be like.  That hasn’t changed. You know I love the ranch but these last two days made it plain I only love it when you are there.  Come to think of it that’s  true of every place & every time.  When you aren’t there I’m no place, just lost in time & space. I more than love you, I’m not whole without you.  You are life itself to me.  When you are gone I’m waiting for you to return so  I can start living again. Happy Anniversary & thank you for 31 wonderful years. I love you Your Grateful Husband",1

"I didn't realize until now just how badly I mishandled our relationship. By being apart and not talking for so long, I quickly learned that you were everything I ever wanted and, by being so afraid of losing you, I ended up chasing you away by scaring you. It wasn't until now that I've realized that instead of complaining about the time I didn't have with you, I should've cherished the time I did have because it was real and filled with affection.You are always on my mind. I realize now how special it was to hear your voice.I realize I miss all the little things you do. I miss the way we look into each other's eyes and understand without saying a word. I miss the way you trust me with your children and you with mine. I miss the way you write ""I love you"" on a steamy window or mirror. I miss the way you signed to me that you love me or give me a kiss or hug while the kids aren't watching. I miss the way we joke that we are attached at the hip while fixing supper and the way we wrestle while tickling each other. I could go on and on, but you know what I'm saying. Yes, it's the little things I miss the most. The little things that I recklessly take for granted.The promise I made to you is a promise that I will keep forever, no matter what. You will always hold the prime place in my heart. Even though I'm dating here and there, I compare each one to you. You've set the bar very high for me, and that's a good thing because I refuse to settle for anything less. When I read your e-mail, it was the happiest I'd been in weeks because I regained a friend who means the world to me.Before I close, I want to sincerely say one last thing straight from my heart. I'm sorry I tried to force you to play by my rules. I realize now that what I miss the very most is you!",1

"When I was a little girl, I dreamed of that one person with whom I would share my dreams, happiness, and life. I could not see his face, but he was there. I always felt he was out there. I just needed to find him. I visualized the bond we would have and the courage he would give me to get through life's obstacles. All these years that I have been with others, feeling my way through life, learning lessons that later on would prepare me to become the person I am now. I've been sad and alone.

That's because I will never forget all the happy moments that we shared together.The day you left me, I didn't know what to do.

Today, I received a threatening letter from a collection agency, demanding payment for the flowers I returned.Since I have refused the flowers and have explained the situation twice before, I consider this to be harassment. I will not be bullied into paying for something that I did not order. If this continues I will take legal action rather than have you tarnish my good credit rating. ",0

Featuring a wide and diverse cast including the talented and celebrated actors (Name) and (Name), and benefiting from the innovative and skillful set and costume design of (Name), the theater's productions have regularly received the admiration of both the local and statewide press.Given this strength of quality and reputation, people are often surprised to learn that the theater is an entirely nonprofit operation.

"I am writing you this letter to express my love for you. I know we have been through some tough times, but then we never started our marriage off on the right foot. We have been apart now for six months, and it has been the hardest time of my life. I tried to steel myself to keep you from hurting me again and built a wall of defense around my heart. Now you have come back into my life again, and the wall has begun to crumble.There is nothing more in this world that I want other than to start our marriage over again. I know that you are just as scared as I am, and you are afraid to take the steps to do that. I want us to forget about the past that brought us the hurt and pain that we caused each other and that caused us to start all over again. I want you to feel the passion, affection, love, and care that I have to offer you and that I have never been able to show you. We found something special together, and I don't want to give that up. We need to give this marriage the fundamental chance it never had. I know we can do it if we try. I have always said that you are my soul mate and the one I would be with forever.My heart is here waiting for you and ready to put it on the line again to try to make our marriage work. Will you do the same? I am taking this second chance and having faith this marriage will work. I need you to do the same, or we might as well call it quits now. I believe that God will give us the support that we need to make this love last forever if we do our parts. We invited him into our marriage nearly five years ago and asked Him to watch over us and protect us. I believe He will do so again.There is no other way to say it other than, ""I love you, Baby, with all my heart and soul."" I am not ready to give up on us. But I need your help and your love, too, because I cannot do this on my own.It's not necessary for you to respond to this letter. I just wanted to express how I felt inside. I just want you to know how much I love you and I miss you. You will see how happy we can be together, and you won't regret it.",1

A minute later, you sent me a note, on the back of which you wrote your telephone number. I was seeing someone else then, but I felt my heart skip a beat when I saw your smiling face. I'll never forget the conversation we had then. Although you're not much of a talker, your presence alone is enough to make my day. You claimed that I was your ""love at first sight.""As the days passed, I realized that it was wrong to try to be in love with two women at the same time. Upon knowing my consciousness, you withdrew yourself. I still remember that painful moment. There were tears in my eyes, but you just walked away without turning back. I never heard from you since that day, nor even bumped into you anywhere. After a year and a half, I still have feelings for you.My other relationship didn't work out, and I was hoping that I might find you. ""Miracles do happen,"" people say, but I didn't believe it until I saw your face one day, but now, at last, we're together! I just want the whole world to know how much you mean to me. You are everything to me. I lost you before; I don't want to lose you again. Till now, I always asked myself, ""Could this be real? Is he the ONE for me?"" The positive answers to my questions are in your hands. I have faith in you and never will I give that up. Without your love, I'd be half a being. Maybe one day you will understand. Now and forever, until the end of time, I love you.",1

As our eyes connected, it seemed too fresh and real to be a dream. The fire, the strength, the longing to be loved--words were not needed as the world closed in and our eyes connected our two souls together.I remember when we first spoke, it was as if we had known each other for years. Our conversations went smoothly like changing seasons. I could not have asked the Lord for anything more assuring or hypnotizing than the soothing tone of your voice. You made my days sunny.We completed one another. You thought that no woman good enough for you existed, and then you met me. How I longed for you to know that my feelings were mutual, and that I had never met a man that could read through me and explore my inner core. Please keep in mind that I will not take your heart that I hold for granted.You are a splendid jewel. Never would I let a soul take you away or bring any harm to you. The day I looked into the blue of your eyes, I knew no force could ruin the joining of our hearts.Soul mates do exist, and now I have learned there is beauty behind all imperfections. It took us both years of hurt and pain, and it has paid off for both of us. It's true when they say, ""God makes you meet a few wrong people before you meet the right one.""Thank you for all that you have given me and still continue to give me.",1
"I find the real definition of love in you because you have given me everything. The time we share with one another is breathtaking. I feel safe in your arms. I am happy in your presence. The sound of your voice tells me that I am safe from all danger. In your presence, everything is serene and peaceful.When I am in pain, just being with you is my remedy. I love your thoughtfulness, your kindness, and especially your ability to enjoy life and have fun. You have helped me to find the brighter side of so many experiences. I have grown as a person because you have taught me everything about love.Thank you for stepping into my life. You mean so much to me. I love you!",1
"My world was so empty and dark. But when I met you, suddenly it felt like the sky over me has lightened up by a thousand stars. I love you!",1
"Last September we purchased one of your five-gallon water distillers from your Springfield distributor, John Doe. We find now that the holding chamber has a leak where the stainless steel sections come together, and it loses water almost as fast as it distills it.Since John Doe has moved to another state, I turn to you to honor the lifetime guarantee on this unit. I am returning this part of the distiller for a replacement. Enclosed is a copy of the warranty and my registration number. I understand that I incur no costs with this exchange. I appreciate your service. ",0
"My Dearest, I have not leisure to write much, but I could chide thee that in many of thy letters thou writest to me, that I should not be unmindful of thee and thy little ones. Truly, if I love thee not too well, I think I err not on the other hand much. Thou art dearer to me than any creature; let that suffice. The Lord hath showed us an exceeding mercy: who can tell how great it is. My weak faith hath been upheld. I have been in my inward man marvellously supported; though I assure thee, I grow an old man, and feel infirmities of age marvellously stealing upon me. Would my corruptions did as fast decrease. Pray on my behalf in the latter respect. The particulars of our late success Harry Vane or Gil. Pickering will impart to thee. My love to all dear friends. I rest thine, Oliver Cromwell",1

"Hello, my love. I wrote you this letter so that you would know how deeply you have touched my heart. In the few short months of this last year, you may have come to know me as well as some of my lifelong friends do. That's because you have taken the time to want to know me inside and out, honestly and truly. You made it easy for me to open up again, and that allowed me to connect with you. I learned quickly that you are honest and loving, not to mention beautiful.You have been able to bring out the best in me. You stir up my most passionate, loving emotions. You opened my eyes so that I could see true love, and all that a perfect relationship should be, as well as all that the perfect lover should embody. You are the best.",1
"I sincerely support your pursuit and feel honored by your request for a recommendation.

"From time to time you ask me, ""Why did you choose me?"" Well, the reason is simple. I chose you simply because you are YOU! I have never had anyone treat me the way you do. I have never had anyone be able to just look at me and make me feel beautiful. You make me feel special and wanted. I would never do anything to hurt you. You mean more to me now than you could ever realize. I am hoping that one day I can prove all of this to you! I want you just because you're you!",1
"My love for you tonight is so deep and tender that it seems to be outside myself as well. I am fast shut up like a little lake  in the embrace of some big mountains. If you were to climb up the mountains, you would see me down below, deep and shining – and  quite fathomless, my dear. You might drop your heart into me and you’d never hear it touch bottom. I love you – I love you. Goodnight. Oh Bogey, what it is to love like this! PS.–while I was writing the last page, tear after tear fell on the paper. But I must cheer up — catch! — An astonishing  number of kisses are flying about — The deuce!– I see a whole crowd of them! Ha! Ha!…I have just caught three– They are delicious!–  You can still answer this letter, but you must address your reply to Linz, Poste Restante– That is the safest course. As I do not  yet know for certain whether I shall go to Regensburg, I can’t tell you anything definite. Just write on the cover that the letter  is to be kept until called for. Adieu–Dearest, most beloved little wife– Take care of your health– and don’t think of walking into town. Do write and tell  me how you like our new quarters– Adieu.  I kiss you millions of times.",1

"My beloved angel, I am nearly mad about you, as much as one can be mad: I cannot bring together two ideas that you do not interpose yourself between them. I can no longer think of anything but you.  In spite of myself, my imagination carries me to you.  I grasp you, I kiss you, I caress you, a thousand of the most amorous caresses take possession of me. As for my heart, there you will always be – very much so.  I have a delicious sense of you there.  But my God, what is to become of me, if you have deprived me of my reason?  This is a monomania which, this morning, terrifies me. I rise up every moment saying to myself, “Come, I am going there!” Then I sit down again, moved by the sense of my obligations.  There is a frightful conflict.  This is not life.  I have never before been like that.  You have devoured everything. I feel foolish and happy as soon as I think of you.  I whirl round in a delicious dream in which in one instant I live a thousand years. What a horrible situation! Overcome with love, feeling love in every pore, living only for love, and seeing oneself consumed by griefs, and caught in a thousand spiders’ threads. O, my darling Eva, you did not know it.  I picked up your card.  It is there before me, and I talk to you as if you were there.  I see you, as I did yesterday, beautiful, astonishingly beautiful. Yesterday, during the whole evening, I said to myself “she is mine!” Ah!  The angels are not as happy in Paradise as I was yesterday!",1

"I am writing to remind you of the leak in our roof that needs to be repaired. As you will remember, when the last storm hit we had water coming through the light fixtures, causing part of the ceiling to break loose. Fortunately, we were able to contain most of the water in pans and buckets, so the floor was not damaged. I am worried because another storm is forecast for this next weekend. We will be out of town, so we won't be able to handle the buckets.I am sure you must be as eager as we are to ensure that no more damage is done. If nothing else, perhaps a sheet of plastic could be put over the roof until permanent repairs can be made. I would be willing to help some evening, if you would call to arrange a time. ",0

"This letter is long overdue. So many arguments happened these past few weeks.I just wanted to tell you that no matter what has happened, I still love you with my entire heart, and I know that these misunderstandings don't mean anything more than just hasty words.You may think I don't love you anymore. However, from this day on, I'm going to try harder to become a better person and not to be so stubborn about everything.I know that you are the most important person in my life and that if I continue in this way, I may just lose the love we share.I am determined to become a better person.Hugs and Kisses!",1
"Words cannot describe what goes through my mind when I think of you! It boggles my mind how I can think of someone almost every single second, minute, and hour of every day!You are truly amazing in every good way. There was a time when I just didn't think it was possible for me to love again the way I love you and, yet, we are not together! How can that be?I sit here and ask myself how it is possible that two people who care so much about one another as we do cannot be together! I love you and adore you! I feel we understand and know each other so well--maybe too well sometimes! Our situation is starting to get out of control--all the secrets, all the lies, all the hurting each other!I ask myself if this is all worth it, and sometimes I just want to give in and say ""enough is enough"" and let go, but that's easier said than done. I think of all the good times and all the good in you, and all the beautiful memories in this relationship! People say if two people truly love one another, then they should be able to overcome anything!Sometimes I feel it's only me who has the true love, and yours is some sort of fantasy love. I have put my heart and soul into the past nine months of my life with you. I feel all the effort I have put in this has got to get me somewhere! Then there are days that I just want to let go and say ""enough is enough"" again. But it's easy to propose impossible solutions!You're my baby, you're my love, you're my best friend, you're everything to me right now, so why, tell me why, why is it so hard to just move on? It seems like every time I feel that we are getting somewhere, something happens or someone comes back to cause us problems again. Then I'm right back to square one! It just isn't right. I know you don't want to be with anyone else right now, but I'm not so sure about that! You say that you don't have anybody else in your life, but I think you do! I think there is someone out there getting the time that belongs to me. You say you love me truly and want me to believe you. Well it's hard to do that when I feel you're spending time with someone else.I have already proven my love to you. You know that I'm not with anyone else. I can't be, until I figure out everything about you and me, and everything we have or don't have! I don't want to fight, I don't want to hide, and I don't want to lie! I want to be real! I want us to be honest with each other!Please help me to understand where I stand! You can be so confusing sometimes with your actions and words! This situation is driving me crazy when it really should be giving me unconditional happiness! I decided to stay with you, so I shouldn't complain, but I wouldn't stay if I didn't feel--or you didn't make me feel--there is enough reason to! That's why it's so hard to decide to go! Ultimately a decision has to be made, though.Friendship can remain, but are you ready to give up love? Because if your words still sound real to me when you say, ""I love you,"" then there is no way I can leave you. I'm here because I want to be here, but even a girl in love can handle only so much. Remember, actions speak louder than words! I have not only told you, but showed you how much I love you, too. Sooner or later something has to give. You tell me what that is! You're my one true love, and I will always love you, whether we're together or not!",1
I'm lucky to have a supportive husband like you by my side who loves me unconditionally and motivates me to do my best.,1
"Sorry to hear about your collarbone. I guess you will be off the bike for a while and will have to listen to John's ""I told you so.""When I broke my collarbone, I had a very hard time using only one arm, but then I don't do very well even with two. If I know you, though, you'll make the best of it. Here's hoping for a speedy recovery. ",0
"Without you I am lost. I close my eyes and all I see is your disappointed face looking down at me. I find myself laying there for hours, unable to sleep. I wonder if the day will ever come when you will forgive me and be here to hold me. Whenever I get a chance to steal just a moment with you, I feel so alive again. You make me think I can hold on to another day of hope, with dreams of us being together one day soon. It will not come soon enough for me, but I will hold onto those dreams with all my heart because I believe at the end of every storm there will be a rainbow. Please wait for this storm to pass so we can have our rainbow for the rest of our lives.My heart belongs to you always.",1
"We were meant to be together for the rest of our lives--this we know. Each day that passes, I am aware that it means one day closer to being in your arms again. Each night is spent dreaming of your face and wishing you were next to me again. Right now you are in dangerous circumstances, but I know you are being careful. I love you with more than just my heart; I love you with my entire being. This distance is just an inconvenience, meeting you was fate.",1
"I am flattered that you would request my advice regarding your career path. I can tell from your letter that you have given much thought to your ultimate goal and I encourage you to continue weighing advantages versus disadvantages.You state that your goal is to own a computer software development company. The question is, do you concentrate now on gaining knowledge and experience in management and finance, or do you increase your technical skills?From what you describe, it seems that you are giving equal importance to each area. Perhaps you should concentrate on the area you have the most enthusiasm for at this time. I believe a conscious awareness of that preference may help you make your decision. Let me know if this helps! ",0
"It is really hard to begin to describe the way I feel about you. I have told you for over a year now, and we are still not together. You tell me that you don't feel the same way. No, let me take that back, you tell everyone else you don't feel the same way (you don't love me). If you are afraid of hurting me, then not saying anything to me face-to-face hurts me more than anything. No matter what, I can't seem to stop thinking about you or believing we were meant to be together. I guess that's how love goes. You must struggle at the beginning to find true happiness in the end.Maybe I've tried too hard or have gone the wrong way. I don't know why we aren't together, but I do know my feelings are real. There certainly isn't real communication between us. I definitely am not myself around you, so you really haven't gotten to know the real me.If only we could start over and forget that I have feelings for you, we could get to know each other better. So, am I a hopeless romantic? Then you are a man of pain and anger. I guess I believe there is a prince inside every man, including the beast. No matter what, you will never make me feel sorry for loving you. I don't know if I have made any sense at all, but I'll end this letter now. I have waited a year now to go out with you, but I'll wait forever to be with you.",1
"I think about you every day and every night. When I'm with you, you light up my life. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I wish upon a star every night for you to return to me. The love that I hold for you in my soul is greater than an ocean or the sky above.Please forgive me for all the hurt that I have caused you. Please, I beg of you to forgive me and return back to my side like the way that it was meant to be. I love you, and I always will until the day that I die. Hopefully, when that day comes, I will still have you by my side and your angel face will be the last one that I see. I want to hold you in my arms again, and tell you how much I love you and how much you really mean to me. I love you!",1

One other guy held a special place in my heart for awhile, but you have gone way above and beyond my feelings for him. I didn't think that was possible, but I never wanted to marry him like I do you.You are the first guy I ever wanted to marry.

"Dear Anna: Did I say that the human might be filed in categories? Well, and if I did, let me qualify — not all humans. You elude me. I cannot  place you, cannot grasp you. I may boast that of nine out of ten, under given circumstances, I can forecast their action; that of  nine out of ten, by their word or action, I may feel the pulse of their hearts. But of the tenth I despair. It is beyond me. You are  that tenth. Were ever two souls, with dumb lips, more incongruously matched! We may feel in common — surely, we oftimes do — and when we do not  feel in common, yet do we understand; and yet we have no common tongue. Spoken words do not come to us. We are unintelligible. God must  laugh at the mummery. The one gleam of sanity through it all is that we are both large temperamentally, large enough to often understand. True, we often  understand but in vague glimmering ways, by dim perceptions, like ghosts, which, while we doubt, haunt us with their truth. And still,  I, for one, dare not believe; for you are that tenth which I may not forecast. Am I unintelligible now? I do not know. I imagine so. I cannot find the common tongue. Large temperamentally — that is it. It is the one thing that brings us at all in touch. We have, flashed through us, you and I, each  a bit of universal, and so we draw together. And yet we are so different. I smile at you when you grow enthusiastic? It is a forgivable smile — nay, almost an envious smile. I have lived twenty-five years of  repression. I learned not to be enthusiastic. It is a hard lesson to forget. I begin to forget, but it is so little. At the best,  before I die, I cannot hope to forget all or most. I can exult, now that I am learning, in little things, in other things; but of my  things, and secret things doubly mine, I cannot, I cannot. Do I make myself intelligible? Do you hear my voice? I fear not. There are  poseurs. I am the most successful of them all.",1
"That Sunday night was one of the worst nights we've ever had. Now I just want you to know that, no matter what happens, I will never stop loving you. I said some stuff that I really regret, but I usually try my best to do right by you, and I will continue to do so if you give me another chance.Last Saturday, we had a great night together, and now we are fighting. Now our relationship is hanging by a piece of thread. I just can't let you slip away from me. I love you, and I hope you can forgive me, even with all my faults. You are everything and that is why I asked you to marry me. I want to spend the rest of my life with you so let's make this work, okay, Baby? I love you!",1

I certainly understand your disappointment in not receiving a salary increase for the past two years, especially since your performance evaluations indicate that your work is better than satisfactory.You asked advice about accepting a better-paying position with a rival company, but expressed reluctance about leaving a place where you have many friends. I can understand your dilemma. However, if the rival company is a local firm, you could consider changing jobs and still stay in touch with your friends. Those friendships could continue while you make new friends in a new work place. I think you need to take a long-range view and do what will give you the greatest professional advantage.I am glad always to hear from you so please keep in touch and let me know what you decide.

It is you who I want to spend the rest of my life with. I want to have your children one day too. You don't know how much I appreciate you, admire you, trust you, respect you, and unconditionally love you.I believe this is true love, and you are the one for me. Being away from you drives me crazy and makes me want to be with you right at that very moment. When I think of this separation as a test, then I can deal with it.

"I am writing in support of the Uniform Tax Bill. I am a small business owner supporting five full-time employees and my own family of six. I am also a member of the middle class, which bears the largest share of the tax burden, and I am not opposed to paying my fair share. I have carefully studied the Uniform Tax Bill and I believe it would equalize the burden. The argument that those with the highest incomes would not pay their fair share simply does not hold up with this legislation.

"I really had a sleepless night, tossing back and forth on my bed and thinking about what happened to us that night. I didn't expect it, but I experienced the worst headache ever.We both made mistakes, not trying hard enough to understand each other. I guess we got carried away after all those arguments about whether I had an intimate relationship with someone else or not. I guess this issue has always interfered with our relationship. I know it's been hard for you to understand. Perhaps I need to give you a chance to trust me. Trust is very important, especially in a new relationship, and I have no objection to you finding out whether I have another relationship or not.I know we have both said things to each other that we both regret. I know you said you can't forgive me, neither will you forget. I regret saying what I did to you. I hope you accept my apology because I'm truly sorry for my harsh and unpleasant words.Perhaps there is the chance for us to experience again the trust we have felt for each other. One thing we must understand is that, in every relationship we're sure to experience some problems that we need to work out. We need to try to understand each other and have the trust that will make this relationship work. I know you want to work this out as much as I do. I still have my hopes and I am not giving up on our relationship.I am very sorry for hurting you last night. You caused me pain too and I'm really confused about everything. I very much want things to be stable. I want you to get all the time you need to decide what you want to do. I love you, so please never think that I can forget you. Hope to hear from you soon.",1

"To Josephine, I love you no longer; on the contrary, I detest you. you are a wretch, truly perverse, truly stupid, a real Cinderella. You never write to me at all, you do not love your husband; you know the pleasure that your letters give him yet you cannot even manage to write him half a dozen lines, dashed off in a moment! What then do you do all day, Madame? What business is so vital that it robs you of the time to write to your faithful lover? What attachment can be stifling and pushing aside the love, the tender and constant love which you promised him? Who can this wonderful new lover be who takes up your every moment, rules your days and prevents you from devoting your attention to your husband? Beware, Josephine; one fine night the doors will be broken down and there I shall be.

I have in my notes that the $750 monthly premium provided general dental, optical and medical coverage, as well as maternity coverage. Yet after reviewing your coverage summary, maternity coverage is absent from the list of expenses you insured.Have we miscommunicated information about the premiums and types of coverage? After calling other competitors, $750 seemed reasonable for the coverage I described, but expensive by comparison if you do not include maternity coverage. If you do not include maternity coverage, this firm will withdraw its offer to buy your insurance. Please advise regarding the matter. ",0

"We are very happy to write this letter of recommendation for our young friend, Eric Doe. We have known Eric for about two years, and he has worked for us during that time in two capacities: as our paper carrier and as our babysitter.As a paper carrier, Eric was always punctual and conscientious. I could always count on my paper being delivered at or near a certain time, and when it wasn't there I knew the fault was not with Eric.Eric is also one of our favorite babysitters and is always our first choice. We know that our daughter (age 9) and our son (age 6) are not only being closely watched and monitored, but are also being entertained. He has our complete trust and confidence, and we know that we will always return home to find the house clean and orderly. If the hour is late, the kids are always in bed, asleep. At all times they are clean, safe, and fed.Eric is a serious-minded and intelligent young man, but he is also a very pleasant person. He has a quick laugh and a ready smile.

I love you so much that if I tried to really write how much I love you, I would be constantly writing for the rest of my life.You bring out so much in me that I'm just beginning to see. It's like when we are together, the rest of the world disappears, and nothing else matters but us. I hope I feel this way forever. I want to spend the rest of my life loving you with everything I have to give. Sometimes I feel like I don't deserve someone as loving as you are. Do you know how long I have waited to have someone like you in my life?It wasn't luck that brought us together. You are a blessing to me and I wouldn't trade the way I feel about you for anything in this world. You are the reason why I smile. You are the first thing on my mind when I wake up every morning, and you are the last thing I think about every night before I close my eyes, but our time together doesn't end there because you are the only thing I dream about. I really do want to spend the rest of my life with you if you will allow me to. Nothing is too much to give you. I feel that if you're not happy, then the world needs to stop until you are!Baby, I just want to thank you for loving me like you do, and I am forever in your debt, just for you being good to me. You know, it is strange how I had to go through so many bad situations before you came into my life. I guess it really is true when they say good things come to those who wait because I've waited for someone like you all my life, and you really are the best thing that has ever happened to me.I just want you to know that I love you so much, and I want to be with you till death do us part! I love you, Baby Girl!I Will Keep Waiting For YouI sometimes wonder what you're doing, or whether you are thinking of me, like I'm thinking of you. I have been thinking of you for 20 years, since the day I was born, really.You have been elusive to me in so many ways but, because none of my objects of infatuation turned out to be you, I feel as if life sometimes may have fooled me, yet I know you are out there. I mean, how could I have seen your face and still overlooked you? Or how could I have heard your voice utter words and not have found anyone that sounded like you? Are you in the stars every time I look up? Of course you are. You are the clouds in the skies, the songs the bird sing every morning. You are everywhere, really. I know you are real. I just constantly wonder why I have not found you yet.Why haven't I been able to say all that I want, show you all that I am, and give you all I have now? Why is time making us wait so long? We don't know, because this is a factor beyond our control. I will always love you, Darling, and when we finally find each other, it will be God's greatest reward.So, wherever you are, know that I love you and you will be the one that lurked passionately in my dreams. Know that I am always longing for you and your presence. Know that you will always be everything to me. Even though I have not yet met you yet, I love you, my spirit lover.",1

"This letter is my heart-template in which my burning feelings for you will finally be expressed. If you can remember, I sat by your side at the Public Library, only two days ago.I really enjoyed the special moments I spent with you at the library. You struck me as being mild-mannered and sophisticated. In fact, your elevated words added some seasoning to my life. Sitting by your side that day, I was totally captivated by your charm and good looks. If you noticed, I was not wholeheartedly doing the assignment given to me. You were my total preoccupation, believe me. I wondered why I should ever get carried away by somebody I hadn't met before. Are there any particular things that I was hungry for that I found in you? I don't know. I just quickly realized how exquisitely beautiful and unique you are. Your long, wavy hair, tied back with a ribbon, really intoxicated me. I must confess, I have fallen in love with you, my dear. I watched myself slowly gravitate towards you. Since that day, it appears that our lives can be like the lives of the world's famous lovers.To me, you're a rose that should be protected from thorns, a delicate angel who needs a defender. To be your defender, I promise that I'll do whatever it takes to make you happy and keep you safe.I'm serious when I say, ""I love you."" I usually rhapsodize about your outstanding natural beauty to my friends. Your beauty hit me with a force of a poetic sledgehammer. I love you and cherish you.

First of all, it was not limited to a ""fringe group"" of one particular religion, but had the support and participation of all Protestant groups in the State. Nothing was said about the study sessions, talks, and publications that came out of the meetings. In fact, your broadcast seemed to focus on one unfortunate incident in which a homeless man had an altercation with a security guard. This was hardly what the conference was about. In all, your coverage was so inaccurate that it could lead one to believe that your station has significant prejudice against religious groups, regardless of their activities.An apology is in order. You should consider the ramifications of such irresponsible reporting, which will surely not go unnoticed by the public. As for the undersigned and the hundreds who were in attendance, we have lost confidence in the credibility of your news reports. We hope you are interested in regaining this confidence and look forward to your correcting the problem. ",0
"After almost 41 years of marriage, I miss you as if we were newlyweds. I love you and can't wait till these three weeks apart will be over. I think of the passionate love-making awaiting both of us when I return. It will be like a second honeymoon to embrace you and make passionate love to you once again.I love you, I need you, and I want you as if I had just fallen in love with you for the first time. Absence does in fact make the heart grow fonder.",1
"Our meeting on September 17 proved to be a very productive step toward strengthening and the University's General Education program. In addition to getting a better understanding of why the program needs strengthening, we were successful in organizing three important subcommittees to get the work going. Suzanne Johnson will head the subcommittee responsible for handling student and faculty surveys, while Jane Doe will head the subcommittee that will draft the initial proposal for the Academic Vice President's office. In addition, John Doe will head a subcommittee that will evaluate the effectiveness of alternate tracks.We will meet again on October 18 for these committees to present their initial reports. Let me say that I sincerely appreciate the good will and willingness to serve that I sense from each of you. ",0
"Many people don't like to speak up when something bothers them, thinking that it is trivial to mention it. Unfortunately, after repeated times of not speaking up, some small incident occurs, which becomes the proverbial straw that breaks the camel's back and an argument develops.I feel like this is the story of our relationship. I hate arguing with you. I hate hearing that pain-filled tone in your voice, or feeling your cold shoulder. I'm not naturally an angry person; you've known that since you first met me.Our recent argument was caused by so many things: my insecurities, my lack of self-worth, my selfish desire to be the only one that makes you smile. I know that the blame is mostly mine.I'm sorry for not taking the time to be patient with you, to sit and listen and understand the way you feel. I know that you want to keep the good relationships with your friends and family and should not resent them.If you could ever forgive me, I will make up for it.",1
"Today my life has been changed in a way I cannot yet accept. I have so many questions running through my mind. Please consider my delicate heart. I am as a child made out of glass and to lose you would shatter me.How is it that so much time spent loving and caring for someone can suddenly crumble into nothing? How can words of tender endearment suddenly be turned to comments of blind hatred and revenge? Why is change such a feared entity? Where is it we go when we step outside the comfort of familiarity? How do we recreate joy when so much emotion is trapped beneath the rubble of failure? Where do we find the know-how to pick up all the delicate shards that reflect the beauty of true love?Is there a cloth gentle enough to wipe away the blood of our bleeding hearts? How can we absorb the surrounding happiness of our friends, when our close friendship has been sapped of any remainder of happiness? How can true love end? The transition between love and friendship is a blurry path. Please remember you have been in my place once before.",1
"I love you from now until death do us part. Right now, you're living so far away that it is killing me, but I know in my heart that we are doing the right thing. You are trying to get things straight, so we can spend a lifetime together and live there forever. I don't want to lose you to anyone else or because of anything that anyone has to say about you. I want you to know that I love you from the depths of my heart, and my love for you is unconditional. My love for you is so strong and the most powerful feeling that I have had in a long time that I am at a loss for words to tell you so. I just wish that there was another way that we could be together without living so far apart at the time being. I want you to know that I love you and always will, and there is nothing that will ever change how I feel about you. I love you.All my love, now and forever.",1
"Oh let me repeat that name a hundred times, a thousand times over; for three days now it has lived within me, oppressed me,  set me afire. I am not writing to you, no, I am close beside you. I see you, I hear you… Eternity in your arms…Heaven, hell, all is within you and even more than all… Oh! Leave me free to rave  in my delirium. Mean, cautious, narrow reality is no longer enough for me. We must live out lives to the full, our loves, our  sorrow…! Oh! you believe me capable of self-sacrifice, chastity, temperance and piety, do you not? But let no more be said of  this… it is for you to question, to draw conclusions, to save me as you see fit. Let me be mad, senseless since you can do nothing,  nothing at all for me. It is good for me to speak to you now. This is to be! To be!!!",1
"RE: Describing True FeelingsI am writing you this letter to tell you how much you mean to me, and to thank you for coming into my life. You are something I never thought could exist for me. You are the best thing that has ever happened in my life, and I don't regret telling you how I feel.I have been through many relationships, but didn't really take any of them seriously. I was used and abused by a guy who I really loved once. So I decided to play guys the same way that guy had played me. I wasn't born nasty; a guy made me this way. Since then I have not taken chances with a guy again. But you happened; you came into my life and stole my heart away from the day I met you.At first I was confused. I didn't really know what I wanted. I didn't know if I wanted to take a chance again and actually take you seriously. So, I decided to come close to you as a friend and find out who you truly were first and what you were really like. You seemed cool, nice, and funny--some things I really liked in a guy. So I took a chance and got together with you.In the beginning, things didn't seem to go very well. I actually had my doubts about you, and I wasn't sure you were actually taking me seriously. But it was too late to turn back. I had already fallen for you from the day I first met you, and I wasn't really looking forward to giving up so soon. I tried so hard to know you. I wasn't going to let you go so easily!Well, time has passed, and I have discovered new things about a new me. You have truly changed me. Still, in a way, I'm scared, because I'm growing a deep feeling inside my heart that I just can't explain, but I know it's there waiting for you to come and uncover it. I truly don't know what your feelings are, but I don't want to force you to tell me something you don't really feel towards me. I want to receive love and trust from you when you truly mean it. All I ask of you is to show me you care and not to hide anything, and to also trust me the way I trust you.",1
"This is not a sudden urge that has prompted me to write to you. When I first met you, I was struck by your warmth and by your sweetness of manner and speech. It soon became difficult for me to shut you out of my mind. Your bewitching smile captivated my heart. The more I tried to forget you, the more I began to think about you, until it dawned upon me that I had fallen in love with you. I've gotten the chance to know you in our swimming class, and I want you to know you've captured my heart. I know this is not right for me to tell you all these things so soon, but I can't help it.After we parted company last night, I had wonderful memories that filled my heart as I walked along the path that led home. Thanks for filling the emptiness in my heart. You're an angel in disguise that came down from heaven to brighten my life.Now that I've found you, I promise to take good care of you. Even though I don't know what your true feelings are, I'll still love you the best way I can. Thank you for those things that you've done for me. If the time comes when you find someone you love better than me, just let me know; even though it hurts, I'll set you free.",1
"I don't know how to approach this with you in person. Every day I fight a battle with myself in which my heart says I should tell you how I feel, but my head tells me not to be stupid. It would just cause damage to our friendship, and that you wouldn't be interested. I am not totally discounting the possibility that my feelings could be reciprocated, but as I have had very little luck with you in the past, my hopes are fairly small.I know there is probably very little I can say to change your mind either way. I do feel that given the chance, this could turn into more, but I guess that would depend on you, and how you feel about me.I can't pinpoint what it is, exactly, that makes me feel that you do have some feelings towards me. Maybe it's due to the way that when I talk to you, how you nearly always look me in the eyes; so few people do that anymore. Your eyes seem to speak to me.I wish I could vocalize my feelings to you, but my fears prohibit me from doing so. I think that by the time I finally gain the courage, you will have found the person you are looking for. My biggest fear is that if I would tell you, then I would see a look of fear or horror on your face that would break me.I wish I could tell you how every time you don't turn up for work, I fear that I will never see you again. When I see you, and sometimes you look down, I wish you would open up to me and let me into your life. I know it wouldn't be easy, but I still believe that I could be good for you, if only you could return my feelings. I know I may not be the best-looking man you know, and I don't have much to offer you financially. All I could offer you is my heart and soul.I fear this will not turn out the way I hope, but I pray that it does. As I said before, you may never know the true extent of my feelings, although I imagine you have some suspicions what they might be.This may be a crush or an infatuation but, I swear to you, it does not feel like it. I have had crushes before, but never really felt the depth of emotion I do for you.I hope that if I can muster the courage to tell you how I feel that, whether or not you can reciprocate, it will turn out okay, and that at the very least we can be good friends. I do long for so much more, though.",1
"I recently talked to my father about expanding a business I am running on the side. Since he knows of several successful businesses that have gotten their start with your financial backing, he gave me your name as a possible investor.At present, I am selling my home-baked brownies to fine restaurants. These moist, rich chocolate brownies have generated more attention than I ever anticipated. My customers jokingly say that brownie lust is what brings them back. Several are ordering an ever-increasing supply to the point where I cannot keep up with the demand. In addition, a national chain of gourmet coffee houses has approached me to contract with them for their desserts, which would include more than brownies.I would like to make this a full-time endeavor, but I lack the funds for larger equipment purchases and salaries for two full-time employees. With expansion, the business has great potential. I would like to meet with you to discuss the possibility of your investment in detail. I believe we could both benefit substantially. ",0
"As you have requested, the shipping department is sending you thirty additional copies of the Doe Employee Handbook and training materials. It takes John approximately three days to compile the shipment and four days to deliver it. In addition to the paperback manual, the training materials should include three overheads, a video, several photocopied handouts and a tape cassette.I did not include a VHS or tape recorder because I am sure the general manager of your division has that equipment. If you find you need additional supplies, please notify me and I will send them before the training session. ",0
"My love for you grows greater every day. I fall in love over and over again. My only thoughts are of what I can do to make you happy, to allay your fears and restore your faith in me and your love for me. The more I love you though the more I fear losing you. I have no idea the thoughts, feelings and memories that haunt you and keep you from loving me the way that I want and need you to. I only know that what ever it is that effects you so deeply must be real and profound and that only you can work through what is confusing you so. But know that I am here for you a new and changed man ready to give you everything I have in my heart and soul to help you.What and who I always thought you were is not what or who you have become or are becoming. I only hope and pray that the journey you are on of self discovery includes me when you reach the end of that journey. The last eight weeks have been a time of self discovery for me too. I have looked inside myself to see who I am, what I want and what kind of future that I want ... I am my wife's husband, a man who adores and worships her, a man who loves her unconditionally, who respects her and only wants the best from himself for her and only wants the best that life has to offer for her. I am a man who thinks his wife is the most beautiful, sexy and desirable women and a man who wants no other women other than his wife. I am the father of her children, a man who conceived his children with love with their mother and wants to raise them with the love and by the side of their mother. I am a father who wants to teach his sons what he has learned about respect, love, honor and above all else appreciation of and for a women that they will love. I am a father whose wife and children are the most important things in his life and will never do anything to jeopardize that. What this man wants is a family that enjoys doing things together, finds joy with each other and learns from each other. I am a man who wants a wife who feels the same way and looks at me adoringly and who I can arouse the same passion for me in her as she does for me. I am a man who wants to work hand in hand and heart to heart with his wife to have a future where each day is better than the day before. I am a man who wants to know his wife's interests, fears, passions, wants needs and desires so I may help her realize them or support her in her pursuit of them.That is who I am and what I want--no money, no big house, no cool job, just those things. These are what truly matter to me now.I know you have been disappointed by so many, taken advantage of by people you trusted. I know you have been belittled and minimized. I know you have been what others have wanted you to be and that you lost yourself even before you even knew who you were. I am so sorry that those things happened to you and I regret and accept my part in some of those things. But I will spend the rest of my life making up to you for that transgression.Baby, so much of what happens in life is pure chance, had I not gone into Chili's that night there would be no sweet natured, polite boy Tyler, there would be no stubborn strong willed, aggressive little boy Logan and Jonathan may or may not have had the benefit of a father. Your life and mine would be drastically different--maybe better, maybe worse. Think back to all the major things in your life, the drastic changes good and bad. If you follow them back to the source they were mostly pure chance that takes us down those paths. From the people we meet, the jobs that we take to the traffic light that holds us an extra five minutes and changes our day completely ... all chance, all luck.But the decision that you will make regarding us is free will--not chance, not luck but a thought out decision that will have profound effects and changes on so many lives. We, going our separate ways, might work out for the better but it is still an unknown thought. I can't say what is best for you. I can only say what is best for the boys, you and me as a couple and all of us as a family. If we weather this together there is nothing that can ever break us apart. We will be so far down the road, more mature, more secure and more in love than ever before.I want you to know that the Ron you fell in love with is still here inside of me but there is more, there is a mature man here now--a man who truly understands what love means, a man who now understands what honoring a woman he loves requires. A man who will spend his life showing and proving his love every day and a man who will put your happiness above his own because he loves you so much.Your disappointment and fears that you feel resonate in me, I feel them and I hurt for you: for the hurt, uncertainty and fear that you are living with. It also scares me to think that the love I feel and the effort I am applying to prove my love and desire for you may not be enough to sooth and calm your hurt, fears and disappointments. If you let yourself, I believe you can find a life that satisfies you right here. I believe if you let go and let me in to your heart, that your desires and passions for me can be rekindled. I know that I love you enough to let you grow and blossom into the person you want to find and become. I believe that we can be closer than ever, learn more about each other and become one with each other. In other words I believe in us.You only know the pain, hurt and neglect of this relationship. Your basis for comparison to what you imagine could be is skewed by the bad memories of the past. If you let me in, let me prove to you that my change and feelings are profound and real I believe we can make it through. The ember of love that is glowing that is keeping this relationship together can be fanned to roaring flame of passion and love.For better for worse, in sickness and in health till death do us part, I believe in that, I am committed to that. I will honor it gladly, happily with love and passion. You are what I want--what I need. In my eyes the sun rises and sets with you, you color my world and bring joy to me. You can be what you need to be. Become who you are seeking to become or are destined to become. You are so much more than I ever gave you credit for. You are truly an exceptional and gifted woman who is capable of doing anything and I will never ever think anything less of you. I will always believe, respect and support you in anything you do. I will respect all your talent and skills, I will never disrespect you or think you not capable of anything because you have proved that you are an individual; whole person. A person with thoughts, feelings and opinions that have value and deserve honor and respect. You are a person that I will proud to call my wife, my lover and my friend. What I did not give in the past will flow freely from my heart to you now.You are my world, I am lost without you, I am a rudderless ship floating on stormy seas without you in my life. I love you so, so very much. My desire and lust for you burns hotter than the fire of the sun. When I look at you I see so much beauty, natural beauty and sensuality. For me, that will never change--I promise. If you let me and teach me, I will be the lover that you deserve. I receive so much pleasure and satisfaction when I see you smile or when you're happy and I know I had something to do with that happiness. I will spend the rest of my life as the happiest man on earth--simply by making you happy. I love you always and forever.",1

"I know that my thoughts are only reflecting the loving hope of my heart because, whenever they wander, they always take me back to you. I love you beyond what words can express because you are such an important part of me, such a precious part of my life. Yet it's hard to convey the depth of my love. It's difficult to express the changes you have made in my life and the meaning you have added to my life. Words do not do justice to my emotions when I want you, need you, and love you with every breath of my being. I love you beyond words and action, beyond meaning. My mind, my body, even my senses are full of you. You are as important to my life as the very beat of my heart.

You are a sort of sweet, simple, gay, pathetic ballad, which Nature is singing, sometimes with tears, sometimes with smiles, and sometimes with intermingled smiles and tears.",1

As I write this letter, I can almost feel you near me.Last night, in my dreams, I saw your face. You are so beautiful. You were standing at the beach and the wind was blowing through your hair. Then I started to reach you but as soon as I was getting nearer to you, you faded away, and I couldn't do anything about it. I started to bow my head and began crying, but then I heard your voice calling me. As you faded away, I found myself remembering everything about those beautiful moments I did spend with you.I always dream of you this way.

My attorney has called the credit card company and will shortly contact you to clear up this misunderstanding. ",0

You've given me more in three months than anyone in my life has before, so please believe what I feel for you is real. You are a very understanding and patient man.I know I have a hard time expressing myself to you. I'm sorry for the crazy things I say and for the way I behave sometimes. But all I ever ask of you is to keep loving me and continue being my man and, in return, I'll never stop loving you. I owe everything to you, because I would not know what it feels like to be loved if it wasn't for you. So, with everything I have inside me, I want you to know that I will be honest, loving, caring, and always true to you. I will never let you down.

We have determined from the picture you sent that the 3 HP motor was one that we sold over five years ago, and we no longer stock that model.

However, we do carry a large stock of universal propellers, which we offer at reasonable prices. Please come by the store and we will be pleased to help you. ",0

"I am concerned about the way some of our book club members use the club as a forum for their political views. Our initial purpose in organizing the club was to meet monthly to encourage the reading and discussing of good literature. We have followed that philosophy for many years, but it seems the newer members want to spend most of the time on political issues.As you know, I have nothing against political activity. I have championed as many causes as anyone in the community, but I don't want to see our book club become a political action group. I hope you will bring up this issue at our next meeting and see if others feel as I do. I sincerely hope we don't lose the friendship and intellectual stimulation that has characterized our club for so long. ",0

"Sweetheart, Please, please don’t be so depressed — We’ll be married soon, and then these lonesome nights will be over forever — and until we are, I am loving, loving every tiny minute of the day and night — Maybe you won’t understand this, but sometimes when I miss you most, it’s hardest to write — and you always know when I make myself — Just the ache of it all — and I can’t tell you. If we were together, you’d feel how strong it is — you’re so sweet when you’re melancholy. I love your sad tenderness — when I’ve hurt you — That’s one of the reasons I could never be sorry for our quarrels — and they bothered you so — Those dear, dear little fusses, when I always tried so hard to make you kiss and forget — Scott — there’s nothing in all the world I want but you — and your precious love — All the material things are nothing. I’d just hate to live a sordid, colorless existence — because you’d soon love me less — and less — and I’d do anything — anything — to keep your heart for my own — I don’t want to live — I want to love first, and live incidentally — Why don’t you feel that I’m waiting — I’ll come to you, Lover, when you’re ready — Don’t don’t ever think of the things you can’t give me — You’ve trusted me with the dearest heart of all — and it’s so damn much more than anybody else in all the world has ever had — How can you think deliberately of life without me — If you should die — O Darling — darling Scott — It’d be like going blind. I know I would, too, — I’d have no purpose in life — just a pretty — decoration. Don’t you think I was made for you? I feel like you had me ordered — and I was delivered to you — to be worn — I want you to wear me, like a watch — charm or a button hole boquet — to the world. And then, when we’re alone, I want to help — to know that you can’t do anything without me. I’m glad you wrote Mamma. It was such a nice sincere letter — and mine to St. Paul was very evasive and rambling. I’ve never, in all my life, been able to say anything to people older than me — Somehow I just instinctively avoid personal things with them — even my family. Kids are so much nicer.",1

"I have been asked to nominate the candidate who has, in my opinion, accomplished more than any others in our research field and is deserving of the Outstanding Humanitarian Award. Without hesitation, I choose Dr. John Doe for that honor.Dr. Doe began making contributions toward understanding communicable diseases when he was still studying for his doctorate degree and he continues twenty years later with the publication of his recent book summarizing his theory on virus mutation.I had the honor of working with Dr. Doe at the Center for Communicable Disease for two years. During that period, I developed enormous respect for his dedication to the center's work. I also became acutely aware of his great knowledge and skills as well as the endless hours he worked in a determination to help humanity in its struggle against disease.It has been a privilege to know this brilliant and dedicated scientist and humanitarian. I nominate him and ask that you please call on me if I can further assist you in this regard. ",0
"Thank you for asking my advice relating to the problem with John Doe. I must agree that the situation is a difficult one.I suggest that you start off by speaking to the entire group about the problem without singling out one individual. If that has the desired result, you need take no further action, but if Mr. Doe persists in this behavior, you will then be able to speak to him privately, reminding him of what you said previously. This way, you will still have the option of using the grievance process later if it becomes necessary, but you will have at least tried to minimize confrontation between the coworkers. In any case, I am confident that you will be able to handle the problem with tact and diplomacy! ",0

Having a mechanic that one can trust gives a welcome sense of security in today's world. I will recommend Doe Auto to all my friends. ",0

These words I will hold in my heart, which is already bursting with the joy I have felt since we have been together.I miss you more than I ever thought I could miss anyone. That is no surprise to me, because I love you more than I ever thought possible. Somewhere I read that distance makes the heart grow fonder.

Eventually, you look back and discover that you've formed a vibrant, colorful, and priceless piece of jewelry.We are working on that piece of jewelry. Already, we have created so many breathtaking memories together, memories that we will always treasure.

"I was sent down to earth on a mission, a mission to find someone that would complete me. I never thought that my task would be fulfilled till the very moment that I met you. That's when I finally found the perfection that I had been seeking all my life. At that very moment, I didn't believe my eyes as the girl that I had thought only existed in a fairytale was now standing in front of me. Each night, as I stood staring at the moon, I saw your gentle smile, the smile that gave me the strength to make the impossible possible.My love for you grows each and every day. I am totally addicted to you, and you are the only drug that keeps me functioning now. When I look into your eyes, I see the real me, a person that lives for a goal and a purpose now.

For now, I've written this letter to declare my love for you and to tell you that I am here waiting for you now.",1
"The first time I heard you say the words, ""I love you,"" it was like I had been taken to Cloud 9, and I haven't come down until now. Right after you uttered those words, I asked myself, ""Do I love him?"" As I looked for an answer, I asked again: ""Have he given me any reason not to?"" No, just more reasons to love you. I then realized that I had already fallen in love with you, and I am so in love with you still.In the past, I had always yearned for someone to love, to cherish, and to take good care of--someone with whom I could share my dreams who would help make them come true. I had always walked around feeling an emptiness that I thought would never get filled, but you filled that hole. I think back to how empty my life was without you, and I am so grateful that you are here now. I have found in you what it means to love. I tell you a hundred times a day, every day, that I love you. Although you return these feelings and love me, too, I don't know if you understand the magnitude of what they mean to me. You may not realize it, but when you do the slightest thing for me, it warms my heart. Each day I fall more in love with you. I love you more and more with each passing day. It eases me to know that, as tomorrow approaches, I will love you more than yesterday, and tomorrow I will love you more than I do today. You are really God's gift to me--His answer to my fervent prayer that I will forever cherish in my heart.You are the most wonderful, kind, compassionate, romantic, smart, sensible, intelligent, talented, thoughtful, congenial, appreciative, loyal, loving, passionate, handsome man I have ever met, and I thank God every day that you are mine! I love you with my whole heart and soul, my whole being, and nothing in this world can take that away! I love you more than I could ever express in words. More than I can understand. You have touched my heart in ways no one could ever comprehend.I hope today turns out to be the day I hoped it would be for us. Today, I'd like to give you this little glass that holds the unrelenting memories of my past that shackles my being. I just have to give this to you and I have to do this for myself, for you, and for us. Today, I give my life to you--my heart, my mind, my body, and my soul. I belong to you now.This may start sounding like a romantic poem. I don't know. I just want to let you know that you are my heart and my soul mate, and that I love you with everything I have and hold. Now, when I look towards the future, I always see you there. Maybe, in this lifetime, you will never know how much I love and cherish you. Your love gives me the feeling that the best is still ahead. I can't wait to spend forever with you.Happy Birthday, Honey! I love you so!",1

I knew somehow that this kind of love existed, but I was almost convinced that it was buried in the sands of time.Since you have come into my life, I know now that there still is and can be true love. Some may ask what about the difficult times? I can honestly say I welcome the opportunity to experience every emotion I have with you, as long as we can do it together.

"I have a suggestion that I believe would make shopping at your Springfield store more inviting. I appreciate your desire to carry a wide variety of merchandise, but I believe that a slight reduction in variety could reduce congestion in the aisles and make many customers very happy. It seems that the congestion is discouraging to some, especially those who have difficulty reaching the high shelves or who need carts to carry their purchases. If a reduction in variety is not possible, I would suggest that you move the advertising displays to the front of the store to free up more aisle space. ",0

"As an attorney and a long-time friend of your parents, I am pleased that you would turn to me for legal counsel. I am also pleased to say that you really don't need my services. There is no reason why you cannot handle this in small claims court. If you follow my suggestions below and attend the hearing, you will surely be able to settle your claim with a minimal filing fee.First, call or stop by your county court house and pick up an application for a hearing of your claim at the small claims court. Then tell the judge the story you told me about purchasing rugs that were misrepresented as Persian. Show your purchase receipt and the advertisement, along with the rug expert's appraisal, which clearly identifies the rugs as made in India and not Iran.This direct experience with our judicial system will not only save you attorney fees, but will most likely be decided in your favor. I believe this experience will prove to be a rewarding one. ",0

"I am honored that you would ask for my advice regarding which college you should attend. I can only tell you about my experience attending State University in Springfield. I had a very good experience there; the computer science department is the best in the state and the classes are small and personal. Compared with many other colleges, the cost of tuition is low. The social life at State is fun but not rowdy. If you are planning to study computer science, I think it would be a good choice. If you plan to study something else, I am not the best person to give advice.Of course, there are many personal factors you must consider, but State University was certainly a good choice for me.

It was really very kind of you to think of me, but I'm afraid I'll have to decline. With so many intervening semesters since you were last a student in one of my courses, I'm too unfamiliar with your current work to be of any real service to you.In my experience, admissions offices generally look for recommendations that reflect a student's most recent academic successes. May I suggest you approach a few instructors of courses you've taken within the past two or three years for a recommendation? They can probably give more weight to your cause than I could.If I can help you in some other way, please feel free to ask. I wish you the best as you plan for your future. ",0

"Dearest Bunny, Do you know what this is–a wedding anniversary letter. I think it should arrive about on the right date. Do you remember that hot  June day thirty-three years ago?–the church jammed–Father with a lovely waistcoat with small blue spots–the Rough Riders–the ushers in cutaways–the crowds in the street–your long white veil and tight little bodice–the reception at Aunt Harriet’s–Uncle Ed–your  mother with one of her extraordinary hats that stood straight up. And do you remember what the world was then–little and cozy–a different order of things, wars considered on the basis of a Dick  [Richard Harding] Davis novel, a sort of “As it was in the beginning” atmosphere over life. We’ve come a long way down a strange road since then. Nothing has happened as we imagined it would except our children. We never thought we’d roam the world. We never thought our  occupations and interests would cover such a range. We never thought that our thirty-third anniversary would find us deep in our  second war and me again at the front. Well, darling, we’ve lived up to the most important part of the ceremony, “In sickness and  in health, for richer for poorer, till death do you part.” Much, much love.",1
"I love you from now until death do us part. Right now, you are living so far away from me I feel it is killing me, but I know in my heart that we are doing the right thing. You are just trying to get things straight so we can live there forever and spend a lifetime together. I want you to know that I love you from the depths of my heart. My love for you is unconditional. My love for you is so strong and the most powerful feeling that I have had in a long time. I am just at a loss for the right words when it comes to you. I just wish there was another way that we could be together without living so far apart now. I want you to know that I love you and always will. There is nothing that will ever change how I feel about you. I love you--I truly do.",1

I will be eternally grateful that I found you and that you found me. I think we are a perfect match!How easy it would have been not to show any interest in one another when we first talked. Instead, we both chose to listen as we looked into each other's eyes, and I felt there was an immediate rapport. Didn't you, too? We understood that the person we were meeting would be different and unique. That realization was quick and very real.Now we have a chance to expand our love. Finding each other was a miracle and keeping our love alive will be another part of that miracle. I promise to do all that I can to keep us together, and I know that you will, too.",1
"My Dearest Husband …I was at that date of marriage a very different being from what I am now and stood in relation to my Heavenly Father in a very different attitude. My whole desire was to live in love, absorbing passionate devotion to one person. Our separation was my first trial — but then came a note of comfort in the hope of being a mother. No creature ever so longed to see the face of a little one or had such a heart full of love to bestow. Here came in trial again sickness, pain, perplexity, constant discouragement — wearing wasting days and nights — a cross, deceitful, unprincipled nurse — husband gone… When you came back you came only to increasing perplexities. Ah, how little comfort I had in being a mother — how was all that I proposed met and crossed and my may ever hedged up! …In short, God would teach me that I should make no family be my chief good and portion and bitter as the lesson has been I thank Him for it from my very soul. One might naturally infer that from the union of two both morbidly sensitive and acute, yet in many respects exact opposites — one hasty and impulsive — the other sensitive and brooding — one the very personification of exactness and routine and the other to whom everything of the kind was an irksome effort — from all this what should one infer but some painful friction. But all this would not after all have done so very much had not Providence as if intent to try us throws upon the heaviest external pressure… but still where you have failed your faults have been to me those of one beloved — of the man who after all would be the choice of my heart still were I to choose — for were I now free I should again love just as I did and again feel that I could give up all to and for you — and if I do not love never can love again with the blind and unwise love with which I married I love quite as truly tho far more wisely… In reflecting upon our future union — our marriage — the past obstacles to our happiness — it seems to me that they are of two or three kinds. 1st those from physical causes both in you and in me — such on your part as hypochondriac morbid instability for which the only remedy is physical care and attention to the laws of health — and on my part an excess of sensitiveness and of confusion and want of control of mind and memory. This always increases on my part in proportion as a I blamed and found fault with and I hope will decrease with returning health. I hope that we shall both be impressed with a most solemn sense of the importance of a wise and constant attention to the laws of health. Then in the second place the want of any definite plan of mutual watchfulness, with regard to each other’s improvement, of a definite time and place for doing it with a firm determination to improve and be improved by each other — to confess our faults one to another and pray one for another that we may be healed… Yours with much love H.",1

I don't really understand why you chose to do what you did, knowing how much I loved you at one point.I was always there for you, no matter what, and even after you cheated on me and broke my heart, I still tried to make it work but that was foolish.

I remember the technician having problems with the computer, so I assume the double-billing was the result of some mistake at that time.I am enclosing a copy of my bill. I believe the best way to correct the problem would be for you to credit my card account with the amount charged for the service. If you will handle this problem immediately, I think everything will be okay. Thank you. ",0

"As you know, I've been in the process of applying for various employment opportunities over the past weeks. Recently, I received a very desirable offer to fill a position at an energetic and exciting company. Although both a resume exhibiting experiences and credentials suited to the job and a successful interview certainly contributed to my success, I feel that your willingness to speak as a professional reference on my behalf played a central role in the company's decision to offer me the position.I am writing to express my gratitude for your time and consideration in support of my endeavors. Your perspective and encouragement mean a great deal to me. Thank you for all that you've done. ",0

"I would like you to correct an error in the way my automobile insurance is rated. My name is John Doe and my policy number is 12345.You have rated my pickup truck as being driven over 7,500 miles per year, even though I assured my agent that I would drive it only to work each day, which is a five-mile round trip. I know the average mileage is 10,000 per year so it is natural to assume that I would drive about that far, but I do not.I have driven only 1,400 miles this last year and my current odometer reading is 4,200. If you wish to check the reading after a year, I will be happy to cooperate. In the meantime, please correct my policy and adjust the premium accordingly. ",0
"Our love started with so much hope, so many dreams. It was a fairy tale that took us both by surprise. It blossomed into a true love that bonded us together. My Darling, my heart and soul belong to you. My destiny belongs in your hands.Our memories are filled with so much joy, and yet so much pain too. In my heart, I know the joy outweighs the pain. I want to embrace the joy and hold it close to my heart where it can live forever. I want to remember the pain as a lesson, a lesson of how much we almost lost. A lesson of life to be lived with a memory of how not to behave. You and I have reopened the door of conversation. I want to know the man you truly are. We can never hide from each other again. This journey I ask you to walk with me will be joyous at times and rough at other times. I don't offer you perfection. I offer you me, a woman who has weaknesses. As long as we can share, and I can show you me (the true me), I feel strong.My love, I don't know how we are going to work thru all of our problems, but I want you to know I am here for the long haul. I want to be with you for the rest of my life. I want yours to be the first face I see when I awake and the last one I seen when I close my eyes at night. I want your hand to be the one I am holding when I die.I have never doubted my love for you, and have never doubted the love you have for me. How do you think I have survived the last four months? I had to leave you for a while because feeling that love and not being able to express it or see it in your eyes was creating such suffering in me. I felt like I was dying inside. Your love has filled me with such warmth, such light, but not to be able to truly feel it coming from you was the darkest, most frustrating hour of my life.I need you. I need to feel you in my arms. You don't know how hard this is to admit to you. For I haven't admitted that I need anyone for so long. Especially not to myself. It really makes me feel vulnerable. Maybe with your help I won't have to feel this way any longer. I do need you, as surely as I need to take my next breath.I need us to hold hands and laugh together, love together, and also to cry together. My life is joined with yours, my love. Not just for the present, but for the past and for the future. Especially for the future. We are separated by so much distance but my love, you live in my heart. You are never far. All I have to do is think of you and you are here.I wish I could offer you promises. I wish I could paint a future with no uncertainties. But I have none to offer. I have no idea what the future holds for us. I just know I want us to experience it together. I think it will be an adventure. Even as I write the word ""adventure "" I know what it means. We have shared so many, and they have never had to be earth-shaking. They are the little ones that have climbed into our hearts and found a home. They are the kind that have created the sweetest memories. They are the kind that only you and I can share and appreciate. That's where my love for you comes from. That and knowing so many new memories await.Sometimes the depth of my feelings for you takes my breath; sometimes just the thought of you makes my breathing more energizing than any I have ever experienced at the same time it calms and soothes me. Sometimes, it's so light, it's not like breathing at all, and that's when I'm sure I'm in love. That's when I'm sure it's true and lasting. It's not just when I think of you, it's when I think of us. But it's really not a thought either, it's an inner presence, it's a sureness.I am trying to be patient for us to be together again, and you know I'm probably the most impatient person in the world. I don't care how long it takes for us to work this out because I am so sure of the outcome. For me the outcome is a life of happiness.My Darling, come dance with me for the rest of our lives.",1
"My wife, Jane Doe, fell and broke her arm while we were traveling in California last month. She was treated at the California Medical Center, where, as out-of-state visitors, we were required to pay for her care at the time treatment was received. The total came to $1200. I did contact our Primary Care Physician, Doctor Smith, within 24 hours of the accident, as required by the terms of our policy.Our policy number is 12345. I have enclosed the statements and receipts from the California Medical Center. Please reimburse me as soon as possible. ",0
"I am sitting here, thinking about you, thinking about all the things we've talked about, all the things we've said to each other, thinking about the many times we said, ""I love you"" to each other. Those three words have never lost their value, even though we've said them more than a hundred times to one another. I know you are somewhere on the other side of the world, thinking about me too. Wherever you are, I walk by your side. When you go to bed, I am laying down with you. When you sit down to eat, I sit next to you, too. When you are combing your hair, I am there kissing and stroking it, smelling the shampoo you use. I am so in love with you--and I can even feel you here beside me, holding me, saying, ""Love, come with me."" I would come with you anywhere without hesitation.My love, all I am saying now is that I am so happy to have found you. You mean everything to me. You are my earth, my water, my sun, and my moon. You are everything that gives life in my world, everything that maintains life around me. Having you with me is like being reborn. Before you, I was dead. I was like a zombie wandering around with no destination, or a robot that people commanded. I didn't have a life with any meaning. Now I have you, and all I want to do is be with you and feel you near me. I want you to know that you are wanted--how much? That is not something I can describe in words. I can't wait until I can kiss you, hold you, and just show you how much you are wanted. We will be together soon. It will warm my heart just to look in your beautiful green eyes again. I love you so much!",1
Every moment I spent with you seems to me like treasures. I will preserve you and these treasures lifelong. I will never let you go away from me. I love you.,1
"Our life seems to be full of complexities. At times we laugh, at other times we shed tears. Once in a while we just stare at each other and, yeah, also fight. Nonetheless, despite all of our apparently inconsistent ideas, we manage to move forward and survive together. We might have caused each other pain that might not even fade with any word of apology. Nevertheless, I am confident that everything that we've gone through is merely part of a strong structure that heaven is building for us. I love you so much! To say this a million times is not enough to express how much I really do. I love you dearly and still will beyond the stars.",1

"This letter is prompted by the noblest of impulses, so don't misunderstand the message it is going to convey.When I met you, as if by a God-sent blessing, I thought that I saw a light of soft understanding. What had come over me? I never felt like this before. Yes, before I met you, I lived a peaceful life. I could come and go and feel no trouble. But now, I am disturbed, both body and soul.Can it be my imagination, or is it that love has struck too deeply, and I must pay for what is asked of me? I have tried to restrain myself. I have tried to stifle my desires, knowing that I am not worthy. But love's orders are imperative. Who am I to battle the call of fate? I know that when I saw you, Cupid had marked me for his victim. Yes, it is love that has taken root in my heart.Let me console myself that I have loved you in name only, a way that lingers only in imagination, in a mere dream, in fantasy, the creation of my lonely heart. Here I am still longing for your attention. I love you!",1

"We have known each other for so long now. We played together in preschool, learned to read together in grammar school, chased each other for kisses in middle school, and then fell deeply in love in high school. From the simplest tasks to the most subtle of feelings, we've grown together through it all.Now, more than ever, it's clear that the crossing of our paths was not just random--the crossing of our paths was meant to be. You and I are two of a kind, two deeply connected souls. Without you, my world is unimaginable, and I wouldn't know how to exist anymore.I have always loved you and I still love you now. Stay with me forever. Love me until the end of our lives.",1

To Fanny Brawne: I cannot exist without you – I am forgetful of every thing but seeing you again – my life seems to stop there – I see no further. You have absorb’d me. I have a sensation at the present moment as though I were dissolving ….I have been astonished that men could die martyrs for religion –  I have shudder’d at it – I shudder no more – I could be martyr’d for my religion – love is my religion – I could die for that – I could die for you. My creed is love and you are its only tenet – you have ravish’d me away by a power I cannot resist. John Keats,1
"The love you have brought into my life is a dream come true. Your kiss, your embrace, your voice--I never could have imagined the joy and comfort such blessings create. Each moment of the day, from sunrise to sunset, I long for your sweet lips and for your arms holding me tight. You are truly the knight who has swept me off my feet, protected me from the bitter past, and always stood beside me.For all the days of my life, I will be thankful for you. I will forever long for you to love me with your warm touch, warm embrace, and with your passionate kiss. Every moment you give to me is precious and new. I love you. You are priceless. You are a gift from God. I love you with all my heart and soul.",1
"Exactly one year ago, you were diagnosed with a serious illness, and all our dreams came crashing down. Neither one of us thought that we would ever have to deal with something like this in our happy life. You were so remarkably strong during what must have been the most difficult time of your life. No one knows, not even me, how difficult those few months really were for you.I never thanked you for being so strong and understanding for both our sakes. At that time, I was so afraid for you and for our future together. I still worry sometimes, although I know you have completely defeated the illness. No one understands why we decided to go ahead and get married. If they knew how much we loved each other, they would not even wonder about it. I love you more than you could possibly know, and my love keeps growing every day. I love you so much, and I always will.",1

Thank you so much for your love, you advice, and your prayers.I know that I can't give you as much love and care as you've already given me because I know I can't be an angel like you are. You are an angel of love and kindness. I really adore you and want to offer you my loving feelings. I want to give you a special prayer: God bless you and may you live a long and healthy life. No one can take your place. Please know that I'm here for you every second of my life with all my love and best wishes.",1

"I appreciate your confidence in asking for my advice regarding running for the position of mayor of Springfield. I don't have a lot of experience in politics, but I will share my thoughts on the matter.I think it is time for new leadership in the mayor's office, and your experience as a city council member has been good preparation for the position. In addition, you are respected for your many years of community service in the city sports program and on the volunteer fire department.On the other hand, you would be running against John Doe, and he has a lot of support from the business community. You would have to take into consideration the amount of support he will receive from that group. He will receive ample financial backing from them, but if you can get the support of the education leaders, I think you can have a very good chance of winning.I know there are many factors for you to consider; this won't be an easy decision. Whatever you decide, you can count on my support. If you would like to discuss any of these issues further, don't hesitate to call. ",0

When I look to the sky, I will know that you are up there looking down on me. Whenever the wind whispers softly, it will remind me of you, and I will smile. You will always remain in my heart, and I will forever remember you.As I sit here writing this letter, I have tears in my eyes, but I smile when I think about having you as my special angel. You will forever be loved and never forgotten. You will always have my heart, no matter how far from me you are.

"Since you asked for my opinion regarding whether you should go into business for yourself, let me share with you my experience. I opened my business when I was about your age, and I remember what a difficult decision it was for me.Working for yourself has both pros and cons. On the one hand, you are your own boss and can set your own schedule and do things the way you want to. On the other hand, you will work much longer hours in your own business than you would for any employer, and if you make a mistake, there is no one else to blame. Although you have the opportunity for greater financial success if you work for yourself, the risks you take are also much greater.While I have personally found great success and satisfaction running my own business, I know it isn't for everyone. I suggest that you continue to ask advice from other successful business owners and do careful research on the specific type of business you are considering. With your willingness to work hard and your unique ability I am sure that you will find success, whatever your endeavor. Good luck to you, and please feel free to consult me if I can be of further assistance. ",0

"Honey, you are my lifelong companion, in joy and sorrow, and my true soulmate! I could not be more in love with you!",1
"Hey, Baby, I know we haven't been dating very long, but I want you to know that I love you from the bottom of my heart. From the moment I first met you, I knew that I wanted you in my life, whether as just a friend or something more. Baby, I prayed for a long time to find someone like you--someone willing to fight alongside me, someone to make me smile and someone who would truly love me. You're in my thoughts, my dreams, and every breath I take.I know that this is true love. I feel like I can tell you anything. You know things about me that even my best friend doesn't know now. You're always there to pick me up when I fall and to dry my tears. Thank you, Baby. I love you.",1

"Since management has refused to negotiate in good faith regarding changes in retirement benefits, we have no other recourse than to begin our strike at 12:01 a.m. Sunday, March 15. We will remain on strike until an agreement is reached that will not penalize the families of those who die before retirement.As difficult as a strike is on everyone, it is far more difficult for a family that is relying on a breadwinner's retirement to have it taken away. Our case is strong, and we hope to return to work soon. It is important that we show a united front in this issue that will affect many of our families. ",0
"I think about you all the time. We are so close now. It's not like I feel that we have drifted apart. It's just that I want to let you know again how much I am in love with you.

I don't know what I did to deserve you, but I must have done something right! Being with you makes me feel like the entire world is mine. One day we will marry and have a houseful of kids. I am dreaming about that already. I love you, Baby, and I am yours forever!",1

"Best Beloved, I send you some allumettes (lampshades) wherewith to kindle the taper. There are very few but my second finger could no longer perform extra duty. These will serve till the wounded one be healed, however. How beautiful is it to provide even this slightest convenience for you, dearest! I cannot tell you how much I love you, in this back-handed style. My love is not in this attitude,– it rather bends forward to meet you. What a year has been to us! My definition of Beauty is, that it is love, and therefore includes both truth and good. But those only who love as we do can feel the significance and force of this. My ideas will not flow in these crooked strokes. God be with you. I am very well, and have walked far in Danvers this cold morning. I am full of the glory of the day. God bless you this night of the old year. It has proved the year of our nativity. Ha not the old earth passed away from us?–are not all things new? Your Sophie",1

I'm lost without you and can't think about anything but what our destiny could be. Suddenly, I close my eyes and imagine your hands caressing my face, fearing that you'll feel the tears running down my cheeks. I know you're hurting as much as I am, but I don't want you to feel sorry for me. I love you, and I'm not sorry for loving you. You have given me so much happiness, and I know you love me now in your own great way. I miss you so much, and the fear of losing you is driving me crazy.

"I do not know where to begin, so I guess this is just as good a place as any. Right now, I'm thinking about you. It's funny how thoughts of you fill my day, my heart, and my mind. I know that you love me, and you must know that I love you too. You and I have connected on such a high level that our minds exchange the same ideas, and our hearts beat as one. Yet you still say you're not sure our love will last once I know all about you.Everything that I feel runs so deep that I don't care about your past and all the things you've done that you feel you should be ashamed of. My love is unconditional, and it will always be here for you. I don't want you to wake up days, months, or years from now, wondering what would have been or could have been. I know you see the love that I feel for you, and I wish that you could trust that love. You say that I am ""star-crossed"" and that I don't know the true you. I don't believe I could be ""star-crossed,"" because I am sure of my love for you. Let's get together, so we can talk about it.",1

"It feels like I have spent my entire life trying to find someone like you. You were my first love, my only true love. You are the one person I've loved more than anyone in the world. There is no reason to fool myself anymore. I loved you from the first moment I laid eyes on you, and I have ever since.As I look back on our past together, I often wonder how you were ever so patient with me. Until this moment, I have never realized just how lucky I've been to have you in my life. If I had been you, I would have walked away from me a long time ago. Yet your love was so unconditional and pure, like the beautiful person you are. You always accepted me for who I am, willing to sacrifice everything for me. I don't deserve an angel like you.It brings tears to my eyes to realize how many times I might have lost you, how much I took your love for granted, and how many times I was foolish enough to think that I could fix my life on my own. Please forgive me for all my foolishness.I have finally opened my eyes and realized that I love you more than words can say. I don't know how many lifetimes it will take to make up for lost time or to repay the kindness and endless love you've shown me, but I want you to know that I am going to try.All I ask is please be patient and understanding, as these times are difficult and a struggle for both of us. I am torn between survival and my feelings for you. Life throws us many curves. The path may be long and hard but, in the end, the road widens and life changes for the better.You don't have to say anything or do anything. I just wanted you to know that no matter what happens in this life, you will always be the special love in my heart. It's true. As they say, it is better to have loved and lost, than to never have loved at all. I am happy that I knew true love, for it is from that love I have gained my most cherished memories.From now to eternity, you'll be in my heart every moment of every day. Thinking of you makes me happy and, for as long as I live, I will never stop dreaming of the reunion of our two hearts.Thank you for sharing your love and your life with me. Thank you for showing me true love.",1

"Due to skyrocketing candy consumption, Doe's will no longer provide unlimited free candy bars to employees. An ""honor system"" can has been placed in the candy basket, and all are asked to pay 35 cents for each bar taken.

"I want to thank for having so much faith in me and in us as a couple. Thank you for making me a better person, and for giving your heart to me, and for opening up to me.The last six months have been wonderful. I never expected to feel this way. You are wonderful and my friends think so too, and so does my family. You make me really happy and, even though we are apart so much of the time, I love when we come together.I get butterflies in my stomach at the very thought of seeing you again. You make everything complete, and I can't imagine having these feelings for anyone else. I'm anxious to see you again. Time is ticking, and it's going by really slowly without you.You say that you are going to make me a happy woman. Well, I want you to know that you have already made me happy just by being you, by showing me love, and by being so open with your feelings. You are what I dreamed of when I was a little girl--someone with integrity, honesty, good looks, and a caring personality. I never thought I would find you, but here you are.I love you so much, and can't wait to be with you again. I want to give you my heart and soul. I don't care about anything else in the world because I am only in love with you. Thank you for making all of my dreams come true. I could not ask for anything more.

"I have tried a million times to put into words how I really feel about you. It's so hard to describe my intense emotions. I knew from the day we met that we were meant for each other.There are so many expressions of your love--the gentleness of your touch, the way your lips feel pressed against mine, the way my knees buckle when you look into my eyes, how a smile lights up my face when I hear your voice, how my body responds to yours when we make love, how happy I am when I am with you. You make me feel all the love I can feel!There was a huge void in my life until you came along. I thank God every day for leading me to find you. I think back to how empty my life was without you, and I am so grateful that you are here now.I can't wait to spend forever with you. You are my life, my love, my soul mate, and my reason for getting up in the morning. I love you with everything that I am.",1
"Hey, there is so much I want to tell you, a lot has been running through my head lately. I'm having trouble putting my thoughts into words, so you will have to bear with me through this.I keep thinking about the future, about life, and what I want out of it. I keep thinking about us and what this relationship means to me. I keep thinking about these things and I realize they go hand in hand. This relationship is my future; it is what I want out of life. I want to grow old with you. I want to experience this crazy love forever and ever, and I really think I'm going to.I want us to walk through new houses, picking the one that would be just right for us. I want to see you walk around our house in a big t-shirt with your hair down and catch me staring at how gorgeous you are. I want you to pull the covers off me at night and then I would have to get even closer, if possible, to keep warm. I want to see you laugh like crazy at me when I do stupid stuff. I want to rub lotion all over your body because you were in the sun too long. I want to have a child with you and go through the experiences of parenthood with you. I want to see you and me chasing our little kid around the house, all three of us laughing our heads off and having fun. I want to hold you when you cry and smile with you when you smile. I want to fall asleep every night with you in my arms. I want you to fall asleep on my chest listening to the beat of my heart and know it beats for you. I want you to be the first thing I see when I wake up and the last thing I see when I go to sleep. I want to see your bad morning hair. I want to sit on the beach with you and watch the sun set, and I want all the people who pass us by to envy the obvious love we have for each other.I want to see you walk down that aisle and I want to take your hand for the rest of my life. I want to spend all night and maybe the next day making love to you with an undying passion. I want to be forty years old and still make out with you like a young schoolboy. I want to cook a meal with you and totally ruin it and end up having to order take out. I want to sit there talking to you for hours about nothing--but at the same time everything--or maybe we won't talk at all, just grin at each other, realizing how lucky we are. I want you to get mad at me for doing something stupid, and I want you to burst out laughing when you try to yell at me, but can't stay angry at me.I want to lay with you in front of a fireplace and keep the heat going long after the fire goes out. I want to take trips with you to places we've never been before and experience them together. I want us to go skinny-dipping in a hotel pool and get caught and streak back to our hotel room, waking everyone up because we're laughing so hard. I want us to go and pick out the hot tub we want with the biggest grins on our faces the whole time.I want to hold your hand when you bring our child into this world. I want our friends to come over and get totally jealous because they don't share a love like we do. I want us to run outside in the rain and act like kids getting completely soaked and, when we come back in, stripping down to nothing as we stumble into the bedroom.I want it to take your breath away when I say, ""I love you,"" because you know it's coming from the heart. I want us to be sitting there and watching our child take his first steps from my arms into yours. I want us to sit down with a box of strawberries, a bottle of chocolate syrup, and a container of mint chocolate ice cream. I want to love you and be with you for at least forever, if not a little longer.I just want you to know that I had never found someone I wanted to spend the rest of my life with until I met you. I really am crazy about you, everything about you.",1

"I had this dream once, and in this dream was a girl--a girl whose smile alone would change the shape of time, move the largest mountains, and speak to the hardest of hearts. A girl who created the greatest joy to anyone around her. A girl who was the most beautiful and amazing woman. I kept dreaming about this one woman who would be all I could ever ask for and all I would ever need. When I met you, that was the first time I realized that this dream I had been dreaming was more than that--it was a reality. You're my dream come true, my all in all, and my love for you just grows stronger.I envision a fully prosperous life now with both you and me in it, and I am glad.

There is so much about you that I know most girls don't see. They are all looking at you just for your body. But, Honey, I am telling you, that is not what I am doing. There is so much more to you than that. I have liked you for a very long time now, but just never had the courage to say it to you. Well, that has all changed now, and I am going to say it. I really care a lot about you, and I would like to be a lot more than just friends. You mean so much to me. I mean, just that special smile when I'm having a bad day just brightens the day and makes it bearable. Or just to have you give me a hug comforts me.

"Baby, I don't even know where to begin! From the first time we talked to each other, I knew you were special. Words cannot even express how I felt the first time we met. It seemed so natural, like we'd known one another for years. Truth is, it's been just under six weeks. I never knew I could feel this strongly about someone this soon, but you proved me wrong. Every time I see the beach or a sunset, I think about that night. Actually, I think about that day and night all the time.It's hard for me to tell you how I feel, because no one in my previous relationships has wanted what we have. And if they had, I was afraid to tell them I cared because I was afraid of being hurt. Please bear with me, I'm working on it. I will slowly be able to tell you how I feel and what I'm thinking.I read this quote today and it's made me think: ""The best way to love is to love like you've never been hurt."" That fits my situation 100 percent. I kept dwelling on the past and what everyone else has done to me. After reading those words, I realized I cannot be with you and be happy and still dwell on what other guys have done to me. I am with you--not them. I need to concentrate on making you happy and letting you make me happy. Up until this point, you've been different than any other guy. I know that you wouldn't hurt me, at least intentionally. That's why you are different. I know you care about me and want to be with me. I am sorry I have doubted that before. There has not been a moment in the past six weeks when I have doubted my feelings for you.You've walked into my life and totally turned it around. I was so depressed and torn up about what had happened to me in the last year or so that I was ready to give up. You gave me the hope that I needed to keep on going. I am so grateful for having you in my life. I've been waiting for someone just like you to walk into my life. Thank you for everything.One last thing before I go. I have wanted to tell you something, but have not been able to bring myself to do so--I love you!",1

I love being with you and acting like fools, and I just love everything about you.You are the best friend I have ever had, but last night when I was trying to go to sleep, I kept thinking about all the other boys. But then I thought about you, and I couldn't stop thinking about you! I thought about all the good times we've had together, and I thought about that day we went mudding on the four wheelers, and I realized that it's not the other people I want to be with, it's you. I love you and I want to be with you, forever and a day.",1

"I am pleased to write a letter of recommendation for John Doe, a young man whose help I have deeply appreciated for the last four years. During that time John has mowed, edged, and nurtured my lawn (and approximately 10 other lawns in the neighborhood) with unfailing efficiency and punctuality. He was 14 when he started caring for his grandmother's yard next door. It looked so good that I asked him to care for mine, too. One by one he has added most of the yards in the neighborhood to his work list.He arrives early each Saturday from March to late September and proceeds to edge all of his clients' lawns. He then mows all of the lawns and hauls the clippings away. At each client's home he asks if there are any special instructions for that day. I have asked him to apply fertilizer to my lawn the first of each month and he has faithfully done so. He has been exceptionally considerate of our needs and expectations. If he must change his routine for a particular week, he always tells us well in advance. He is a courteous, reliable young man who works hard. I highly recommend him to any employer. Please call me if you need further information. ",0

"We appreciate your suggestion that we install more drinking fountains in the mall. We are presently looking into installation costs, but feel confident that at least some new fountains will appear before summer. The building was designed for them, but they were not included when construction costs ran higher than expected. Perhaps the time has come to finish the job right. Thank you for bringing it to our attention. ",0
"We are now ready to move from monthly to weekly production of our newspaper. Having considered both the needs of its production staff and the input of our marketing director, I recommend we no longer postpone this ambitious change. Our paper's subscription base is now adequate to support the hiring of additional personnel, and an infusion of three or four new employees will give a boost to a dedicated but already overworked staff of writers and editors.Growth has always been our goal, and we have now reached the point where concerns about the feasibility of increased production have been put to rest by our increasingly positive public reception, as reflected in sales. John Doe, our marketing director, foresees that demand in the coming year could easily quadruple our current press runs. He also believes a larger pool of writers would make the paper more marketable.I'm eager to hear from you about this. Please let me know what you and other members of the advisory board think. ",0
"Your check for my weekly columns for the month of November is incorrect. Although I usually receive $80 per month, there were five Saturdays in November, and my check should, therefore, be $100. Please increase my December check to $100 to correct this error. ",0
"Before I met you, I never knew I could be madly in love again. As soon as I met you, my heart met joy and my soul felt peace. I was like a land without water, where every plant witnesses drought. I was like a rose without pollen, deserted by every bee. When I found you, a new me was made.Sometime in our lifetime, we meet someone we had no expectation of meeting. Sometimes you meet a special someone and your world experience changes. I met you and started realizing why I have to stay in this world a little longer. There are times I searched for someone who cared for me and loved me, but I never found, until the day I wanted to just give up hope. But as I started to fall, I met your soft, tender hands waiting to lift me up and show me love and care.My heart accelerated at the speed of light, and every time I breathe now, I hear the rhythms of your sweet name, so melodious and charming. With every beat of my heart, I feel the depth of my love for you. Maybe it's because I keep you in the innermost parts of my heart and my soul. Sometimes I even try to stop loving you, but then I realize, ""My heart will never cease passing impulses of my love for you to my soul, because my love for you is burning out of control.""",1
"You have given generously to our family crisis program in the past, and we want you to be among the first to hear our wonderful news!From now until the end of July, the Springfield Retail Corporation has offered to provide a three-to-one match on the funds we raise for our center. This means that for every dollar our donors give, the Retail Corporation will give $3.This generous offer means that our comprehensive Youth and Family Center can finally become a reality. It will cost $960,000 to build, so if we can raise $240,000, we will be able to have all of our youth and family oriented programs in one location. Families in crisis will no longer have to search all over town from agency to agency to find the help, education, and support they need.With your help, we can do this. Will you start the ball rolling by sending $100 or as much as you can afford today? ",0
"We met at work and, in the beginning, you were just someone I worked with. Months passed and all of a sudden my attitude towards you changed and I started to think about you all the time. Our circumstances inhibit us from being together now, but I can't stop obsessing over you. I've never felt like this before, and I don't know what to do. I guess this is a letter recognizing my deep love for you, but at the same I wonder how it can be. I love you with all my heart, and today I have the courage to tell you.",1
"I know it is as difficult for you as it is for me to be separated for so long. Life seems to be full of trials of this type that test our inner strength and, more importantly, our devotion and love for one another. After all, it is said that true love is boundless and immeasurable and overcomes all forms of adversity. In truth, if love is genuine, it will grow stronger with each assault upon its existence.Our love has been assaulted many times, and I am convinced that it is true love because the longer I am away from you, the greater my yearning is to be with you again. I cherish any thought of you, prize any memory of you that rises from the depths of my mind, and live for the day when our physical separation will no longer exist.Until that moment arrives, I send you my tender love, my warm embrace, and my most passionate kiss-across the miles.",1

There are no words to describe how much you really mean to me. I love you so immeasurably, and I appreciate you being there for me whenever I need you. I hold you very close to my heart because you are my best friend, and I cherish every little moment we spend together.",1
"We have been married for about 14 years now. No matter what, you have always cherished me. God purposely gave me to you for a reason. He knew you would always love me and never neglect me. You are my true knight in shining armor. God must have known all along what he was doing when I first met you. I love the way you have always thought enough of me to never leave me and to never hurt me. My heart is like a thin piece of ice--it never takes much to break it. God knew you were right for me from the very beginning. I love you!",1
You're undoubtedly the best when it comes to loving me!,1
"No day goes by without my thinking of you. You are such a great person that I find it hard to believe that you were single for such a long time. It is not easy to be a single Dad, but you do a good job and your children are happy. Each time that I see you, I find you more attractive and more appealing. Not only do your outward looks appeal to me, but I am attracted to you because you have a wonderful sense of humor, and your children seem to admire you and love you. They certainly appear to know that their Dad loves them.Are you truly happy being single now? You say that you are afraid of a commitment. I can understand that because I am, too. We have seen one another a good many times now, and I am beginning to be less afraid of a commitment. I feel that I want a permanent relationship with you, because we have a good time together, and I hate to say ""goodbye"" at the end of the evening. But I look forward to the new plans we make, because we need to see each other again.I guess I am saying that I wish you were mine. I don't want to be without you or have to go home and stare at empty walls. I am asking you to think about marriage. I love your children and I promise to treat them as though they were my own. I promise to love, honor, and cherish you. Will you be mine? That would make me so happy. That's because I love you so much. Please be mine.",1

"I am coordinator of local arrangements for the Daughters of Springfield biennial banquet this spring. As I considered initial preparations, I remembered the silver anniversary picnic that I helped organize last summer and the special decagonal tables that you used.Our banquet will host twenty invited guests, and those special tables would be perfectly suited to our needs. Would you be good enough to let us use two of those tables at the Community Center, Thursday, May 8, from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m.? We can transport the tables, so that need not be a concern. I will call in a few days to see whether this is a possibility. Thank you. ",0

"Sometimes words can sound a bit unbelievable. But right now, I mean exactly what I say: you mean everything to me. Since we've been together and you've been by my side, I feel more joyful, more alive, and more complete than ever. Every time we talk or even look at each other, the depth and warmth of our connection takes hold of me, and I want you to know that I am very grateful.You have become the heart of my life. I'll say it again: you are everything to me. Nothing compares to the love we share, and nothing can come between us.I will be yours forever.",1
"I thought this letter-writing thing was going to be easy, but I guess it's not always that way. I have so many feelings to express that I have no idea where to begin. I never expected to feel this way toward you; to be honest, I tried not to fall in love with you. But it got me, it sure got me good. Now that I don't have you, I need you more than ever! I read a quote somewhere once that said, ""It's not missing you now that kills me, it's knowing that I had you in my life once that does."" That is so absolutely true. But what's really bothering me is that I can't tell you how I feel.I made the choice to let you go in the worst possible way. I screwed up so badly, and I don't blame you for never wanting to speak to me or for hating me as much as you probably do right now. You said some pretty nasty things to me, but I don't hold it against you. I could have said a few worse things if I were in your case. I don't really know! I'm broken, remember?I just want to smell your skin one last time, tease you about your cologne, hug you, tug on your ear, make fun of your whiteness, and how you get all your redness from the sun instead of from a suntan bottle, sleep at your house with the cold AC, and wear your cool CK pants to sleep. I will miss all of that so very much!I'm sorry that I was such a jerk and that I never showed you how much I loved you. I remember when you told me more than once to let go and let you love me. I never listened and kept my stupid guard up. I'm sorry! I will always have our shooting stars to remind me of all our happy times. Do you want to know what my last wish was? I wished that I would never be dumb enough to let you go, but I did! I'm so sorry.",1

I thank you for caring for me in your own special way and loving me through all these years.I wonder each day if we can ever rekindle that love we once shared, because it hurts when I think of you with someone else.Do you remember our song?

"We all move through life as through a journey. Career, happiness, love--these are paths we traverse on our way. For some, these paths unfold effortlessly and with clarity. My journey, the paths of my life, on the other hand, have been loaded with difficulty and, too often, accompanied by failure. I have learned, as a child learns, that with each slap I turn away and learn to expect less.With you, everything has changed. Once again, I have reached for my desires and have followed my deepest feelings. Although I expected a slap and to be turned away, this time, joy and happiness, rather than failure, has accompanied me. I have found pleasure and clarity rather than difficulty.You are the beauty I have wished for my entire life. I love you more than I can say and more than I could ever have imagined. Every day, I know how blessed I am to be loved by you!",1
"I've told you many times and I want to tell you again, I really thank heaven for you in my life. Maybe you will never know how much I love, care, and cherish you in this lifetime.

I never want to lose you, Sweetheart.Though at times you don't always tell me that you care, your actions speak it all. I will always remember the little things you do for me, and I'll keep them in my heart, where you'll always be. I know at times I'm getting out of hand and hard to handle, but your patience is always the peacekeeper for us. As a result, we don't quarrel often. Thank you.In the past I had always yearned for a relationship that is genuine and lasting, and I've found it in you. I'll make sure that the hand I'm holding will always be yours.

I wish I could show you how much you really mean to me. If I could only let you feel how much I really do love you in a kiss or a hug, you would begin to feel the love that I have for you. I will only be able to show you how much I really do love you when we get married. Then you will really know how much I love you. You can hear the sound of my love, though, just by listening to my heart. You can taste the sweetness of my love in a kiss; you can feel it in my embrace.If I could describe the love that I have for you and use lyrics of love songs and even the sonnets of Shakespeare, it would still be impossible, because the love that I love for you cannot be put into words. You've had my love from the day we met, and you will have it forever. As time goes by, my heart and love for you will keep growing stronger, brighter, and bigger.Call me your love from this day forward. You are fully mine, as I pray I am fully yours.

"Experiences over the past several months convince me that I must resign from my position as counselor, effective no later than two weeks from today. When I was initially hired at Doe Corporation, I thought that this was a company believed, as I did, that the relationship between a company and its employees should be mutually beneficial. Poor wages, infrequent raises, uncompensated overtime, routine layoffs, and an excessive workload have convinced me otherwise. Therefore, I can no longer work for a company that clearly undervalues the worth of its employees.I want to thank you, however, for being a wonderful supervisor. I appreciate the time you took to discuss my concerns with me. I know you did everything you could to improve our working conditions, but the fact that your efforts have been persistently ignored by upper management is indicative that things are not about to change in the near future. I sincerely hope that my resignation does not adversely reflect upon you in any way.Two weeks should provide adequate time for me to complete my assignments. According to current policy, I suspect my duties will be assimilated in the usual way. Nonetheless, I will gladly ensure that my more difficult accounts are settled before I leave. ",0

If only you knew how much it hurts me to see you hurt, and it hurts even worse to know that I'm the one that caused you pain. I'm sorry. There are no reasons or excuses as to why I do the things I do, but if only you knew how much I don't mean them. I told you once before that I can't help the fact that I'm stingy and that I only want your love for myself. It would kill me to know that someone else is receiving what I thought was only meant for me. Though you may have heard this before, and I may have said it before, too, but I can't live my life completely without you in it anymore. When God gave me you, he gave me everything I needed. You're all that I long for; you're all I ever wanted. If I could change anything about this relationship, it would only be that we weren't always married.

"I am the neighborhood representative for the area near Doe Elementary School at 1600 Main Street, where we are witnessing an unusual increase in students and traffic. We have an average of fifteen children per block in this new subdivision, and the college student traffic has increased significantly as a result of the large apartment complex recently finished on Maple Street.We are very concerned for the safety of our children and enclose a petition signed by 200 residents who request that the speed limit be reduced to 25 mph in our area and, if necessary, that speed bumps be installed at the student crosswalks. We know that child safety is also important to you and look forward to swift action on this problem before we have an unfortunate accident. Thank you for your support. ",0

This letter is in response to your request for weekly progress reports.Over the last week we have confirmed lecture times with all the speakers, received 1,354 RSVPs and made accommodations for each participant. John has secured a team of receptionists and ushers for the event and hired a team to handle miscellaneous setup tasks.Please set your mind at ease.

I will contact you at the beginning of next week to discuss what we still need to accomplish and how we propose to do so. ",0
"I never thought that I would ever find what it means to really love someone. You have taught me what it means to truly love another person. More than that, our love taught me to feel better about myself. It is because of you that I am the person I am today.

It is because of you that I can smile with confidence, even on a day when clouds are forming with more troubles to overcome. It is because of you that I look forward to each new day. It is because of you that I know that our love is real.",1

All the things I prayed for came into my life through you. Different things you said--and still say--are things that were in my heart that I've never said to anyone but God in my prayers.You brought out the best in me. You've shown me what real love is and how to love. You treat me with such royalty, like a precious gem. You listen to me, and you believe in me. You always know what to say, when to say it, and how to say it at the right moment and at the right time.The love you have for me and for our children builds up my faith that because of God's timing, we have become a happy family. I love you with an unconditional love. It will never stop.",1

I have checked your original order against the catalog price list, and have discovered where the misunderstanding lies. You will recall that you changed your order from the generic brand to Doe paint which has a ten-year warranty.

"It is impossible to live in our city without witnessing the pain of homelessness and hunger on our streets. The statistics are frightening: 1 out of every 20 people is without a home, and a much larger percentage of residents go through each day without enough money to pay for adequate food and other basic necessities. Fortunately, compassionate and informed citizens, such as yourself, understand the reality of these problems and feel compelled to contribute to the solution.(Name of Organization) provides such solutions. For the past two decades, our organization has taken a clear and honest look at the problems of homelessness and hunger in our city. Research, services, and advocacy are at the heart of our mission. (Name of Organization) has been analyzing the causes and conditions, establishing pragmatic and compassionate programs to relieve suffering, forging new methods of intervention, and advancing the fight for more support in the public and governmental spheres.However, upholding these intentions requires a good deal of financial support. As a nonprofit organization, we receive some funding from governmental sources, but the foundation of our financial health derives from the generous contributions of the conscientious citizens of our city. We are writing today, therefore, to ask you to reflect on the problems of homelessness and hunger in our city, and then to consider the value and necessity of the services we provide. We hope you will then use the enclosed prepaid envelope to send us your support in the form of a financial contribution. ",0

I wish that things could have been different, better, so we could have been together still.Every night I fall asleep thinking about you, wondering how you are, where you are, if you're alright, and if you still think of me, and miss me, and love me, like I do you.

"We felt fortunate to get your roofing crew to shingle our new home last fall when our general contractor had legal problems. Your workers were prompt and fast; however, the heavy winds that we experienced last week ripped off several of the new shingles. When I personally inspected the damage, I found that your crew had done a very shoddy job of installing them. They had not removed the plastic covering from the backs of the shingles so the adhesive strip could take hold, and in many cases, they had only used one nail per shingle. It is little wonder that they finished the work so quickly.According to the standard building agreement, materials and workmanship are guaranteed for one year, so I expect you to repair the roof properly before the next storm. Since a year will soon be up and fall weather will be upon us, would you please inform me by August 15 when you plan to have the work completed. I trust this is all the action I will have to take, but I am prepared to do whatever may be necessary to get satisfaction. ",0

"To Adele Foucher My dearest, When two souls, which have sought each other for, however long in the throng, have finally found each other …a union, fiery and pure as they themselves are… begins on earth and continues forever in heaven. This union is love, true love, … a religion, which deifies the loved one, whose life comes from devotion and passion, and for which the greatest sacrifices are the sweetest delights. This is the love which you inspire in me… Your soul is made to love with the purity and passion of angels; but perhaps it can only love another angel, in which case I must tremble with apprehension.",1
"I was up late last night thinking about our conversation concerning your dilemma. You certainly have given it considerable thought. I am concerned that there is an element missing from the process: The spiritual. Have you considered speaking with your minister about this? The consequences of a bad decision here are tremendous. Your minister may provide you with a ""longer-term"" perspective. I know spiritual guidance has been helpful in my life.It's just something for you to consider. I only encourage you to try to see all sides before you decide. Good luck, my friend. ",0

I can't tell you how much you mean to me, or how much I love to just be with you. You make me smile and laugh out loud! You make me feel comfortable, confident, and protected.

"I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but that doesn't mean that I don't think about you each and every day. You don't know just how much I wish that I could be lying there with you, whispering in your ear my heart's deepest desires.I close my eyes and let my thoughts of you flow. I carry on a conversation in my mind between us, as we tell each other our hopes our dreams--if only we could do that. I picture us lying in bed, your arms around me, my head upon your chest, my fingers gently circling over your skin. My soft lips place a whisper-soft kiss on your neck. I can hear the beating of your heart getting louder and faster. In my mind, your lips capture me and hold me there in ecstasy. We look in each other's eyes, lost--no, found. I feel your hands caress me as you whisper against my ear. You make sweet, sweet love to me and wipe away any tears. A slight laugh, mixed with a cry, such beautiful feelings make me sigh. Each time you touch me feels like the first time.As each night passes, your presence seems more real here with me, but then I open my eyes and realize it was all just another dream. Tears fall from my eyes. Pain sears through my chest. My heart is crying out for you.I have tried so hard to fight these feelings I have, but I can't do it anymore. I know that I love you, but I didn't want to tell you because you are leaving the country for three years, and I didn't want my heart to hurt, but I can't stop feeling this way. I am so in love with you, and this feeling grows deeper and deeper each day.We only knew each other for a couple of weeks, and you already had me completely and totally to yourself. I don't even want to think about being with anyone else. I thought that if I stopped talking to you, I would forget how I felt. I thought that if I could keep myself busy, I would be okay, but I can't forget and I'm not okay. I am so overwhelmed by my feelings for you; I am hungry to hear your voice again and to feel your touch. I can't let you go to Japan without seeing you at least one more time.Last week, I put those pictures of you on my desk at work. People walked by and asked me if you are my husband or my boyfriend. I tell them, ""Neither. He is just the man who has my whole heart."" That is the best and only way that I can describe you.I feel terrible that I didn't talk to you these last two months. So many nights I cried my eyes out, missing you so much, but too afraid to pick up the phone because it had been so long. What would I say? What would you say? I am afraid that you would tell me that you don't want to talk to me anymore. I don't think I could handle that right now.I know that you told me that you aren't looking to rush into anything, but this has been eating away at my heart for awhile now, and I couldn't hold it in any more. This doesn't mean that I want to run off and get married or anything crazy like that. It just means that I love you, completely and totally. I am here for you whenever you need me.I'm going to try to call you tomorrow. Hopefully you can forgive me for the pain that I have caused you. I promise I will not disappear again. I love you.",1

"You shall now receive (my dear wife) my last words in these my last lines. My love I send you that you may keep it when I am  dead, and my counsel that you may remember it when I am no more. I would not by my will present you with sorrows (dear Besse) let them go to the grave with me and be buried in the dust. And  seeing that it is not God’s will that I should see you any more in this life, bear it patiently, and with a heart like thy self. First, I send you all the thanks which my heart can conceive, or my words can rehearse for your many travails, and care taken for  me, which though they have not taken effect as you wished, yet my debt to you is not the less; but pay it I never shall in this world. Secondly, I beseech you for the love you bear me living, do not hide your self many days, but by your travails seek to help your  miserable fortunes and the right of your poor child. Thy mourning cannot avail me, I am but dust… Remember your poor child for his father’s sake, who chose you, and loved you in his happiest times. Get those letters which I wrote  to the Lords, wherein I sued for my life; God is my witness it was for you and yours that I desired life, but it is true that I  disdained my self for begging of it: for know it that your son is the son of a true man, and one who in his own respect despiseth  death and all his misshapen and ugly forms. I cannot write much, God he knows how hardly I steal this time while others sleep, and it is also time that I should separate my  thoughts from the world. Beg my dead body which living was denied thee; and either lay it at Sherburne or in Exeter Church, by my  Father and Mother; I can say no more, time and death call me away…. Written with the dying hand of sometimes they Husband, but now alas overthrown.  Yours that was, but now not my own. Walter Raleigh",1

"It's fair to say that the past few weeks have been somber and gloomy for me. It has been like living in the dark, as though a big black cloud has engulfed me.I have also felt like there has been a piece missing from my heart and, although I wasn't sure what that piece was, I now realize it was the part I gave to you. You are my missing piece.Now, slowly, it's as though that piece is being fumbled back into place and I'm starting to see a glimmer of light, just as though someone, somewhere has turned on a light and it's starting to flicker alive.It's hard for me to explain what the feeling is. All I can say is that when I've been with you, lately, the movie I'm watching seems better, the music I'm listening to sounds more alive, even things like doing the dishes are more fun when you're in the room.Everything I've ever done in my life has been better, brighter, and more exciting when I've been able to share it with you.I want you to know that the most important thing in my life is you. Nothing beats holding you in my arms, touching your hair, and smelling the scent that belongs to you alone.I would never want you not to know the way I feel about you. I love you. I'm sure you must realize that, but for me, that is no longer enough. I want you to really know how much I love you.But I so dearly need the comfort and the security of knowing that whenever I say, ""I love you,"" you're going to say the same words, too. But I just wish that sometimes you would say them before I do--and make me believe you don't have to be prompted.I've always felt so lucky that you decided to share your life with me, and there's nothing, just nothing, I wouldn't do to make you happy. I just want you to want me. Just like I want you.There's no price you can put on love. I know you just can't make love come back to the way it was. I know it'll come back, if and when it's ready. I just want you to know that for every ounce of love you give to me, I will give it back to you a thousand times more.I worship you and adore you and no one could ever compete with the beauty I see when you stand before me. I would never do anything to hurt you, I want only to love you and re-build our life together. I don't need anyone else but you.If only I could have come up with the right words to describe the depth of the feelings that I have for you, I would have uttered them to you a thousand times.You're all I've ever dreamt of, and you are the best thing that ever happened to me.I love you more than my life, more than my world. You are my world. Life wouldn't be life if I couldn't share it with you.",1

Every step we take, we take together, and I know that tomorrow each step will grow even sweeter. Our lives have become so entwined that I can feel your every breath as my heart beats. I know even from a distance when you are sad or feeling down, and my heart aches for you. I know when you are happy, and it makes me smile. I wish your every dream will come true. Your happiness is my only wish.",1
"Clara, How happy your last letters have made me — those since Christmas Eve! I should like to call you by all the endearing epithets,  and yet I can find no lovelier word than the simple word ‘dear,’ but there is a particular way of saying it. My dear one, then,  I have wept for joy to think that you are mine, and often wonder if I deserve you. One would think that no one man’s heart and brain could stand all the things that are crowded into one day. Where do these thousands  of thoughts, wishes, sorrows, joys and hopes come from? Day in, day out, the procession goes on. But how light-hearted I was yesterday  and the day before! There shone out of your letters so noble a spirit, such faith, such a wealth of love!",1

I know that the next year or so will be very hard on our relationship. I've been thinking about that a lot these past few weeks. The more I think about it, though, the more I know I have made the right choice. No matter what coming trials we may yet face, I will never give up on our love.I once was told that if you really love someone, then everything would work out just fine in the end, and that if our love was strong, we could make it through anything. Lately, I have realized that is what true love is all about. I want you to know that while you are gone, I will be completely faithful to you. Honey, you will NEVER have to worry about that. I know without a single doubt that God brought us together, and we were just meant to be. I love you and I will forever!",1

Ever since the 3rd grade, I have been in love with you, and considering we are both 25 now, that's a long time.Girlfriends of mine have come and gone, but I always compared them to you, and no one could really compare. I have never known someone so beautiful, so giving, and so honest. I love being with you. I love the memories that we have shared. You're the only one who will ever hold the key to my heart. I've wanted to tell you that for so long, and I just couldn't find the right time or the right words. I love you--and that will never change.You are the most incredible woman I have ever met. You're so outgoing and so friendly--and you always have so much to say. You're so sweet, and your heart is so big. I have never met anyone with a heart like yours, and I love you for it. You're the type of girl that, when you walk into a room, all eyes fall on you, and everyone's heart brightens up. You're the type of girl that men dream of when they close their eyes at night. You're the type of girl that guys can't wait to bring home to meet mom.

I love everything about you and about us. You do something to me that no one else can. You have made me so happy, the happiest I've ever been. You give me the most amazing feelings of being in love with you.I still don't know what I did to be so lucky to have you in my life. Our relationship is a dream come true. I am so thankful I met you.

I don't want to lose you to anyone else or because of anything that anyone has to say about our life.I want you to know that I love you from the deepest part of my heart. My love for you is unconditional. My love for you is so strong and the most powerful feeling that I have ever had. I am just at a loss for the right words when it comes to you.

Sometimes I sit and, without any reason, call your name out loud, until I realize that you are far away, and then I just smile at the sweet thought of you.When I talk to you, it makes my heart beat faster, and I feel sweet feelings, unexplainable, not understandable. I feel your presence everywhere near me, your laugh echoes in my ears, your talks remind me that you really exist, and I want you as much as the roses would need their perfume, like wind needs its song, like snow needs its whiteness, like a little child wants ice cream. I did not plan to love you, it just happened.The world has many beauties: some are lilies, jasmines, irises, roses; some were just simple, plain flowers; none of them attracts me. It was your innocent smile, your sparkling eyes. It was like lightening had struck me, it was like an angel had appeared to me. It was you and your love that made me what I am today.I will love you as long as the sun keeps shining, the stars keep brightening the sky, the winds keep blowing, the snow keeps falling, and the flowers keep smiling.

"I don't know where I should start! Let me start by saying, I love you. I have loved you for as long as I can remember. I guess the first time I told you was when I realized how much you meant to me. We have known each other for years now. Once we got together, I couldn't believe how good things were going. It was too good to be true. It was perfect in the beginning. I loved you, and you loved me. I felt like that's the way it should still be.I didn't want you to leave. Honestly, I didn't. If I could go back, I'd beg you to stay by my side. To know you'd be miles away was breaking my heart, but I wanted you to be happy. I wanted you to make a good future for yourself, for us. Now that I think about it, how could I have let you go? What was I thinking then? Look what has happened.I know we've been through tough times. And because of that I think we have become stronger than we know. We have lasted a good while together, too. I'm so incredibly sorry for everything that I did wrong. I wish you could just tell me, and I would change it all. You know, though, neither one of us were innocent when it came to hurting each other.When I said I would marry you, I meant it. I wanted to live my entire life loving you. We could have grown old together. I know you wanted that. It would have been great. But what happened to us? Where did we go wrong? Wasn't our love untouchable? Wasn't it strong? I sit and think, and the only thing that best explains it is that we needed to be together physically. Having you in one state and me in another was unbearable. Although I really wanted to be with you, I also had school and my life here. If I could go back, I'd probably leave with you when I had the chance. Would things be better now, or is this the way it was supposed to be?All I know is we may not be together for a long time or maybe not ever again. But I want you to know that you are someone I will never ever forget. I loved you, and still love you, and will always love you, no matter what. We've been through a lot. But that love is still there. I hope you find happiness. I hope all your dreams come true. You deserve a lot.I feel very lucky to have had the chance to experience the love we once had. It's something I will forever cherish. Please don't forget it. I know things aren't the best now, but at least we still have our friendship. That's where it all started. I just ask for one thing: be happy, and know that I'm happy too. I will always think about you--and us.",1
"I don't know why you love me. I don't deserve your love, kindness, and never-ending forgiveness. When I mess up, you take the blame for me. When I yell at you, and it's really something I did, you apologize. When life gets difficult and I don't think I can take it anymore, I just sit and cry, but you tell me it's going to be okay. When I think my problems are hopeless, you instill in me hope in tomorrow.I don't know why you put up with me, but I thank you for everything you do for me. I love you more than you know, and more than I could show you or express in words. I don't think I could live without you now. Although things are getting harder, you give me the strength and assurance that one day we will always be together.I trust you with all my heart, and believe everything you tell me. I'm sorry for all the miserable things I throw your way, assuming so many things, jumping to conclusions without thinking clearly. I'm sorry I just start taking my pain out on you. You treat me better than I could hope for, and I'm so grateful that you're mine. God sent you to me because He knew I needed your strength and support. You're wonderful; you're everything to me. I'll love you forever.",1
"When we were innocently playing that computer game the other day, neither one of us were looking for love. We chatted as we played and quickly became interested in one another.I was skeptical at first because of the pain caused me by others, but you quickly erased any fears that I had. You made me feel so comfortable that I know I can talk to you about anything now. You have quickly become the most important person in my life, and I am eager to see where our love goes.The first time I heard you say the words, ""I love you,"" it was like a load had been taken off my shoulders. I heard them, but still was worried. I wanted to hear them again and again for the rest of my life.You have opened up new and exciting doors that I can't wait to explore with you. When I feel your touch, my heart melts and my soul is set on fire with desire to hold you and kiss you. You have become my very best friend and my only lover.

I love your genuine kindness, your eyes, and your lips. I love your sense of self-worth, your calming nature, your social ability, your variety of talents, your smooth back and strong arms. For some reason, though, you have become distant lately, but I hope the strength of our relationship will reunite us soon. I miss you terribly and feel incomplete without you. Please come back soon. I love you.",1
"I'm writing to let you know how I feel about you. I don't know how to tell you face to face, so I am going to put my feelings into words now. Since the day I met you, I haven't been the same. My feelings just can't be tamed. I am starting to care for you in a different way. I think of you every day! I love everything about you! Your smile, your eyes, your hair, your body--I hope you are getting the point. I can't get you off my mind. You have me feeling foolish. I know you may not feel the same, but my feelings just keep growing for you each and every day. Well, what I am trying to tell you is that I am falling in love with you--yes, this is true! But I'll understand it if you don't feel the same. I just have to let you know how I really feel. This is no whim; my feelings are real and genuine.",1
"Where do I start? I wish I could tell you how much I still love you with all my heart. You're thousands of miles away, but I would walk there this instant just to see your smile.You were my great love at one point in my life. You would think that I'd be over you by now, but I'm not. I never told you how much I loved being with you. I became all yours. They say if you let something go, and it comes back to you, it's meant to be. You came back to me once, but then you left me again. I still love you, Baby, and I hope you're doing okay wherever you are. Let's call one another.",1
"Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would meet a woman that could captivate and win my heart just with a ""Hello."" From the moment I wake up till deep in the night, there is no place on earth I would rather be than holding and kissing you tenderly.You are a special woman with unique and intriguing qualities that drive my desire for you far beyond anyone's imagination. Never in my life until the day I met you have I wanted to bring a child into this world, share everything life has to offer, give all my love unconditionally, and grow old with someone till we reached the day we can reminisce of all the years we shared together. Just the thought of offering my total heart to you and spending my life cherishing every moment with you, brings these incredible emotions to me that I have never experienced before.The worst day of my life was letting you slip away three years ago because the timing just was not right for either one of us, but second chances do not come too often in life. I will not go another day without giving us a true chance at a life with love and happiness. I know we can kiss and hold one another again.A wise man once told me, ""When it is real, you will know it."" I know now.",1
"I don't know how to begin this letter; I have such deep feeling in my heart. I never thought this would happen, never thought that it could be over, and that we would say our last goodbye.I want you to know that you will always be in my heart. The times we spent together I will carry forever, deep in my soul, in the hopes that one day we will meet again and still feel this incredible, everlasting love for each other.The choices I have to make are hard and this decision is one that no one should have to make--the choice between family and the one I love. How can this be? Why is this so?I leave you with this final thought: one day we will meet again, and our love will shine again, and each of us will be free to honorably continue this relationship.Goodbye, my love--for now.",1

My love for you, however, never will. From now until the end of our lives, I will be yours and yours alone. I will be your best friend, your lover, and your husband. I will always stand by your side--and never change!",1

I will do everything I can to make this project a success. I appreciate the opportunity to work on it, and I thank you for your patience. ",0
"As I sit here, I'm wondering why I ever loved you so much. I remember the days when we started to talk and then we fell in love like it was always there. I thought moving away would get my mind off of you. It worked, but not for long. I realized that you were the only one that I wanted to have. You just don't know how I feel right now. Sometimes I want to break down and cry because of the fact that you don't know how I feel about you. I'm scared of what you would think right now with all this stuff going on. I love you and God knows I do. I love you so very much. I think I always will.",1

"After 30 years in the trenches, I am retiring from Doe Corporation on June 30. It has really been rewarding and discouraging, carefree and tense, delightful and hateful. Well, you get the picture. It's time to make my way to Tucson, Arizona, for some leisurely golfing and tanning. It has been a strange experience to be replaced by a computer, but at least its feelings won't be hurt when it gets criticized for a statistical error.I have loved my job and co-workers and will miss each of you dearly. My husband and I will keep a vacant room with a comfortable bed for visitors! We hope you will accept the standing invitation. Let's keep in touch! ",0

We are also printing a retraction in the local newspaper. I apologize for the misunderstanding and wish you success with the bond issue. ",0

"Hey, Baby, how are you? I miss you. You have been away so long now. But while you are away, I thought I would write and tell you something that has been on my mind for awhile now. Remember how you asked me if I loved you? Yes, I do love you. In fact, I have loved you for a long time now, but have been too shy to show you my feelings. See, I have been hurt before, and I really didn't want to get hurt again, but then I later realized that you really do love me. You actually do understand me, and you really do care about me. I thought I should let you know how I feel before you think I don't care. When you come back from your trip, we will be able to talk about it more. So, the answer to your question for now is--yes, I really do love you.",1

You were the missing piece of the puzzle. You were the completion I was longing to find, and I am so happy to have found you.You've become my lover and my best friend. You've become all that I could have wanted. I trust you, and I care about you. It brings me such comfort and joy to think of how much you love and trust me as well. Everything seems right when we're together. Everything makes sense. Thank you for changing my life!Blessings, I count you twice. I love you with all my heart and soul.",1
"I know we don't get to talk or to see each other much anymore. But being apart from you for awhile doesn't change the way I feel about you. Sure, I'm lonely, and sometimes I'm overwhelmed. But, just remember that I love you and everything about you. That's what gets me through every long day.Sweetheart, you don't know what I would give to feel your touch once more, to kiss your lips, or even just to see you again. I never loved anyone as much as I love you. You make me feel loved. You make me feel secure. More importantly, you make me feel wanted. We both knew our friendship would grow from the very first day. Neither one of us could begin to imagine the love we would both feel now. You are my soul mate, my best friend, my inspiration, and my true love.Gaining your love has been the best thing that has ever happened to me. I know that I love you and always will.",1

"I have spent my life waiting--not living, not loving, just waiting for the one that would inspire me to be all I can be, to live up to all my possibilities, to reach every goal, to know that I may fail sometime, but I will never be alone. You brought to my cold, empty heart a passion only you could bring. Your words of acceptance and love have soothed the aching in my empty heart, and now I am at peace with myself and the world around me. I knew that one day when I found you, my waiting would be over. I love you with every ounce of my being. Yours is the first name I call out in the morning, and the last one I whisper at night.",1
"I would appreciate receiving a discount on the 50 gross of striped 2-inch plastic balls I ordered from you for the city-wide Youth Activity Day on June 12. I was surprised to see from your statement that you were planning to charge us the regular retail price for these. The balls are normally sold in individual plastic and cardboard packages, but you need neither to package them nor transport them, as our arrangement was that we would pick up the balls, packed loose in cardboard boxes, directly from your warehouse.

I love you, Darling.You have been the one who filled my days and nights when we were having our holiday, and sometimes when you were not available to chat with me, I couldn't sleep that night. You're so important to me. I know these days I am really busy touring, and when I don't have any time to chat with you, please forgive me. It's so hard not to be able to write something to you every day. I want you to know that I always care about you, and you're always in my heart. I want the whole world to know that I love you and that I really care about you. It's open to everyone to see my love for you.I know that it's very hard for both of us to maintain this long distance relationship, but I believe that we can do it. I will wait for that day to come when we are no longer apart. I know it's a bit long for us to wait, but it's worth waiting for, right?I don't know if this can be counted as a love letter or not.

"Wow! So here I stand, no longer alone among the digital masses. Here I stand, surrounded by people who have met on-line, people who have loved and lost, and people who, somehow, in a desperate world, found each other.So what do I say that hasn't already been written or that hasn't already been said? Hmm, pretty tough! Okay--try this: I no longer need to hope for love by going to clubs, (I can't dance, anyway!) I don't have to search for love in personal ads, on the Internet, or in chat rooms, text messages, camera phones, faxes, and e-mails. I don't have to wait for good and bad feedback, or have to need a good laugh, wait to talk, be told to shut up, look for hope, pray for a miracle, wait for an angel, see hope for God's love here on earth, wish for a special friend, crave for my heart's desire, envy other people's romances, or wonder if someone will ever love me.

"My love, my sweet--I look back at the years we shared together, and how amazing my time with you was. Sometimes it breaks my heart to go that far down the road and be reminded of how much I loved you, how much we loved each other. I have never felt a love as deep and true as that which I had in my heart for you. How could two people that felt as if they could never live without each other, and then become so distant and far apart? How can a love that was meant to last, crumble right before our eyes? What happened to our love--what happened to us?I would never have thought that I could have questioned or doubted what we had. You're an amazing man and you've helped me to discover my dreams and inspired me to become the woman that I've always dreamed of becoming. I am a better person because of you--because you believed in me, because you loved me. I love you dearly with all my heart.I look in your eyes and see a love that is still there, but no longer radiant and alive. Does that mean that we stopped loving each other? Absolutely not. You are the dearest person in my life and will remain so. I love you with all my heart, but I accept that we are traveling on different paths. My love for you will always remain constant and my past memories of you will be relived in my dreams. Though our roads are different, our paths will still cross, now and then.

"With one week to go, we are $20,000 short of our sales volume goal. Our average weekly volume this month is $15,560. We have a challenge and an opportunity before us.

"So much is on my mind, although I don't know where to start. To be honest with you, I really think our love is dying. Things don't seem to be the same anymore. I really love you and I want to be with you, but this is not how to go about it.The first time we broke up, you told me you wanted me back and that you loved me. It seemed like it was true, but now I don't know where our relationship stands. I'm feeling really confused. I don't know if I'm your girlfriend or just someone you can make love to. I need answers.What happened to you coming over here after work, or you calling me on your lunch break? You don't tell me you love me anymore, either. I really miss all of that and want things to go back to the way they were.I really wanted to tell you that when we saw each other at the game. You know what hurt the most? You didn't even come over and say, ""Hey,"" or give me a kiss, a hug, or anything, and I'm supposed to be your girlfriend. When do you plan on showing me that I am? It really hurts to know that my own boyfriend--the one who supposedly loves me--can't come over and say ""Hello,"" or anything, but when you're not with your friends and it's just you and me, that's another story.I'm just going to have to leave you. I don't want to do it, but I want things the way they used to be, and it looks like that won't happen. I love you but your love obviously isn't as strong as you say it is.I love you and that's for certain, and I always will.",1
"It's amazing how many days have passed since the first time we became who we are now. I feel as if this is all a dream and soon enough I will wake from it. I hope not. Like you told me the first time, ""I love you, don't hope it--know it."" I know it. We were meant to be. Five years have passed and every day I look at you when you wake up, I still see the boy I fell in love with in high school--those days when we just processed names and students' faces. Now I see the love that was waiting for me all those years ago. I love you, and I always will!",1

"The only no-kill shelter in our area, (Name of Shelter), houses and cares for at least 100 abused or abandoned cats and dogs at any given time. Although some of our animals, especially the younger residents, are welcomed into the homes of compassionate residents of our community, the majority of our animals live out their days within our friendly compound. As the term ""no-kill"" implies, we never sacrifice the lives of these unfortunate animals but rather choose to provide a dignified and loving environment for the remainder of their lives.Of course, providing such a service requires not only a sizeable staff of volunteers but also significant monetary funds. From food to medical treatment to daily comforts and care, all aspects of our operation are paid for by the generous donations of the members of our community. We are writing today, therefore, to ask you to join our cause by contributing to the operational expenses for the coming year. A donation of just $100 would help us cover the cost for the care of two to three animal residents of our compound. Of course, a donation at any higher or lower level would be warmly appreciated as well.For your convenience, we have enclosed a pre-addressed, prepaid envelope with which you can send us your support. We thank you for your time and consideration, and we hope to hear from you soon. ",0
"Do you know, when you have told me to think of you, I have been feeling ashamed of thinking of you so much, of thinking of only you–which is too much, perhaps. Shall I tell you? It seems to me, to myself, that no man was ever before to any woman what you are to me–the fulness must be in proportion, you know, to the vacancy…and only I know what was behind–the long wilderness without the blossoming rose…and the capacity for happiness, like a black gaping hole, before this silver flooding. Is it wonderful that I should stand as in a dream, and disbelieve–not you–but my own fate? Was ever any one taken suddenly from a lampless dungeon and placed upon the pinnacle of a mountain, without the head turning round and the heart turning faint, as mine do? And you love me more, you say?–Shall I thank you or God? Both,–indeed–and there is no possible return from me to either of you! I thank you as the unworthy may.. and as we all thank God. How shall I ever prove what my heart is to you? How will you ever see it as I feel it? I ask myself in vain. Have so much faith in me, my only beloved, as to use me simply for your own advantage and happiness, and to your own ends without a thought of any others–that is all I could ask you without any disquiet as to the granting of it–May God bless you!",1

"Sophie, To be with the people one loves, says La Bruyere is enough — to dream you are speaking to them, not speaking to them, thinking of them, thinking of the most indifferent things, but by their side, nothing else matters. O mon amie, how true that is! and it is also true that when one acquires such a habit, it becomes a necessary part of one’s existence. Alas! I well know, I should know too well, since the three months that I sigh, far away from thee, that I possess thee no more, than my happiness has departed. However, when every morning I wake up, I look for you, it seems to me that half of myself is missing, and that is too true. Twenty times during the day, I ask myself where you are; judge how strong the illusion is, and how cruel it is to see it vanish. When I go to bed, I do not fail to make room for you; I push myself quite close to the wall and leave a great empty space in my small bed. This movement is mechanical, these thoughts are involuntary. Ah! how one accustoms oneself to happiness. Alas! one only knows it well when one has lost it, and I’m sure we have only learnt to appreciate how necessary we are to each other, since the thunderbolt has parted us. The source of our tears has not dried up, dear Sophie; we cannot become healed; we have enough in our hearts to love always, and, because of that, enough to weep always. Gabriel",1

The atmosphere is cold, as if we don't have something in common anymore. It's been so hard for me to accept that we're living separate lives now, looking at things as if we're strangers. The pain that you brought me is not easy to forget. Every day I'm hurting, but trying to survive.Sometimes it's easier because I didn't think about you all day, or maybe I did, but chose to ignore the thoughts. Little by little, I'm beginning to learn how to love myself and not think about you. Sometimes I still feel emotion and think about the past and the good memories we had, even if I knew that it would make me feel worse.My environment, especially in the office, has not been helpful for me at all. It's painful to see you, day in and day out. Sometimes I want to quit and start a new life far away from you, but it's hard. Just the thought of not being able to see you makes me weak. I know it's not healthy, but it's my way of trying to be happy.Every day, I'm waiting for signs, which usually leaves me with hopeless expectations. Every move and every action you make, I interpret. I'm like a fool watching you every moment and so desperate for you to notice my existence. A simple smile makes me happy. A short conversation makes my whole day brighter. I need you to ease my aching heart, and it doesn't take much to keep me going.I'm still not over you. Even if I repeat 1000 times that I am over you, I know deep in my heart that I'm not.

"Since I am unable to get a helpful response from your Springfield office, I am turning to you as a last resort. I own a small parcel of land at the base of Mt.

The State has erected signs indicating that motorized vehicles are prohibited in this area because of the serious erosion they cause, but no one is enforcing the restriction.When the bikers come off the mountain, they often ride across my property, causing deep ruts in the soil and destroying the vegetation. I have confronted them on several occasions, but my requests have been ignored. When I ask your office in Springfield to enforce the restriction, they say they will, but they do nothing. I am enclosing copies of the last two letters I sent, along with photographs of the damage the bikers have done.I trust you will look into this matter and see that proper action is taken to uphold the law and preserve the beauty of the Mt.

"I do not wish to buy mortgage life insurance from your or any other company. I am already adequately insured. Your frequent calls on the subject have become a nuisance. I asked my mortgage company some months ago to remove my name from the mailing lists they make available, and they assure me that this has been done. Kindly stop writing to me and calling me, and remove my name from your list of prospective customers.If your representative calls me again I will be forced to consider further action to stop this nuisance.

"I went to bed last night with a vision of you next to me. I slept like a log all night because I felt you were with me. When I awoke this morning to see if it were real or a dream, reality hit me that it was only a dream. Very soon, though, I know you will really be right next to me, and that I will not have to only dream of it again because you will be right there so we can hold, hug and squeeze each other tight. I long to be there with you now, so that I can help build and support your life there, and so that we can accomplish a lot together as husband and wife.",1

I know, we have seen our share of drama and a little bit of trauma, too, but we have survived it all, and we're still together.I almost can't believe that I am this lucky to have you in my life. I feel that God smiled on me, and now I'm blessed with having you with me. You are so special and so different. You are wonderful and good-looking, too--not to mention unique! There is no one else like you, and I love you so very much!",1

"We wish to express our concern regarding the bathroom facilities in Doe Park on Main Street. Because of the park's convenient location, our neighborhood children spend many hours after school playing on the playground equipment. Although we ask them to come home to use the bathroom, they sometimes use the park bathroom.Some of us visited the facilities this morning and were horrified to see their condition. Vandals have broken the toilet, leaving a gaping hole over the exposed sewer. The children claim it has been that way for weeks. The graffiti is appalling. Until something is done, the bathroom is definitely off limits for our neighborhood kids.Please, either close the facility or repair it immediately. It presents a clear danger to the public health, to say nothing of the moral pollution it represents. We the undersigned ask that your office take swift action. We will be happy to cooperate in any way we can. ",0

"My Dearest Girl, I have been a walk this morning with a book in my hand, but as usual I have been occupied with nothing but you: I wish I could say in an agreeable manner. I am tormented day and night. They talk of my going to Italy. ‘Tis certain I shall never recover if I am to be so long separate from you: yet with all this devotion to you I cannot persuade myself into any confidence of you…. You are to me an object intensely desirable — the air I breathe in a room empty of you in unhealthy. I am not the same to you — no — you can wait — you have a thousand activities — you can be happy without me. Any party, anything to fill up the day has been enough. How have you pass’d this month? Who have you smil’d with? All this may seem savage in me. You do no feel as I do — you do not know what it is to love — one day you may — your time is not come…. I cannot live without you, and not only you but chaste you; virtuous you. The Sun rises and sets, the day passes, and you follow the bent of your inclination to a certain extent — you have no conception of the quantity of miserable feeling that passes through me in a day — Be serious! Love is not a plaything — and again do not write unless you can do it with a crystal conscience. I would sooner die for want of you than Yours for ever J. Keats",1

"If only I could find the courage to give you this letter. I never knew love until I knew you. We shared our minds, bodies, hearts, and souls with each other. We shared a feeling so deep that it simply couldn't be put into words, but I never knew loving someone could hurt this bad. We have hurt each other in ways we promised we never would, too.The love in my heart for you will never change. People say that time heals all wounds. But the truth is, I still dream of you, I still cry myself to sleep thinking of you, and I still wish on every star that you were here with me. I hope and pray every day that I will run into you. I still look out the window, hoping you will pull into the driveway. First thing I do when I come home is check the answering machine. I still love you and want you to have the best in life.What hurt me the most is the day that should have been one of the biggest in our lives: the day our daughter was born. I was scared, I needed you. I always thought in my heart that you would be there for that special moment, no matter what was going on. As I lay on that hospital bed, having your baby, I thought you would show up. I prayed so hard that you would come, but you didn't. You didn't even call to see if our newborn child was okay. I have never felt so scared, lost, and alone as I did that day. I wish I knew why, I wish I could understand. If you ever need me, though, I'll still be there. You have a special place in my heart and, no matter what, you'll always be there.I hope one day you will come around and get to know and love our daughter. She is one gift from our love you gave me that you can never take back.",1
"Could I see you without passion, or be absent from you without pain, I need not beg your pardon for thus renewing my vows that  I love you more than health, or any happiness here or hereafter. Everything you do is a new charm to me, and though I have lanquished for seven long tedious years of desire, jealously despairing,  yet every minute I see you I still discover something new and more bewitching. Consider how I love you; what would I not renounce or  enterprise for you? I much have you mine, or I am miserable, and nothing but knowing which shall be the happy hour can make the rest of my years that  are to come tolerable. Give me a word or two of comfort, or resolve never to look on me more, for I cannot bear a kind look and after  it a cruel denial. This minute my heart aches for you; and, if I cannot have a right in yours, I wish it would ache till I could complain to you no longer.",1

"I have lived for a long time, responsible for and dependent upon no one, answering to no one and committed to no one except myself. During this period of my life, I considered the world mine for the taking and truly believed that I was living life to the fullest. Then you came into the picture and, all of a sudden, I realized that I was deceiving myself.I find that my life is not all that I thought it was. In fact, it is terribly lacking in many things, the foremost being love. Now, through some great fortune, I have found that love and, along with it, the one person who can make my life truly complete.You are that person, and I have fallen in love with you. To be honest, I never thought I would ever utter those words, but now they come forth effortlessly and with great sincerity. I'll be forever grateful to you for showing me just how shallow my life was. At last, I have a chance now to give it depth and purpose.Until I hear from you, I remain totally yours in thought and spirit.",1

" You fear, sometimes, I do not love you so much as you wish? My dear Girl I love you ever and ever and without reserve. The more I have known you the more have I lov’d. In every way – even my jealousies have been agonies of Love, in the hottest fit I ever had I would have died for you. I have vex’d you too much. But for Love! Can I help it? You are always new. The last of your kisses was ever the sweetest; the last smile the brightest; the last movement the gracefullest. When you pass’d my window home yesterday, I was fill’d with as much admiration as if I had then seen you for the first time. You uttered a half complaint once that I only lov’d your Beauty. Have I nothing else then to love in you but that? Do not I see a heart naturally furnish’d with wings imprison itself with me? No ill prospect has been able to turn your thoughts a moment from me. This perhaps should be as much a subject of sorrow as joy – but I will not talk of that. Even if you did not love me I could not help an entire devotion to you: how much more deeply then must I feel for you knowing you love me. My Mind has been the most discontented and restless one that ever was put into a body too small for it. I never felt my Mind repose upon anything with complete and undistracted enjoyment – upon no person but you. When you are in the room my thoughts never fly out of window: you always concentrate my whole senses. The anxiety shown about our Love in your last note is an immense pleasure to me; however you must not suffer such speculations to molest you any more: not will I any more believe you can have the least pique against me. Brown is gone out — but here is Mrs Wylie — when she is gone I shall be awake for you. — Remembrances to your Mother. Your affectionate, J. Keats",1

I beseech you now with all my heart definitely to let me know your whole mind as to the love between us; for necessity compels me to plague you for a reply, having been for more than a year now struck by the dart of love, and being uncertain either of failure or of finding a place in your heart and affection, which point has certainly kept me for some time from naming you my mistress, since if you only love me with an ordinary love the name is not appropriate to you, seeing that it stands for an uncommon position very remote from the ordinary; but if it pleases you to do the duty of a true, loyal mistress and friend, and to give yourself body and heart to me, who have been, and will be, your very loyal servant (if your rigour does not forbid me), I promise you that not only the name will be due to you, but also to take you as my sole mistress, casting off all others than yourself out of mind and affection, and to serve you only; begging you to make me a complete reply to this my rude letter as to how far and in what I can trust; and if it does not please you to reply in writing, to let me know of some place where I can have it by word of mouth, the which place I will seek out with all my heart.

Though you've talked about forever and you say you love me, what do those words really mean to you? To me there is no definition, no meaning that has any value, and I wonder if you are being true. Can I really rely on you? Though you've hurt me many times before, I've always found it in my heart to forgive--forgive the pain and see through the tears. So, I wonder what is the true meaning of our love, or is there really any meaning left? I can't help but ask myself the same questions time and time again.So where does the line between love and hate fall in this relationship? Where is the space between the good and the bad, the truth and the lies? Sometimes I just want to give up on us. But how can I give up on you, when you still have my heart in chains, when you still have your arms around me, around my soul? I want to leave, but I still love you.

My heart did not change.I now realize that we have missed many months when we should have been together. And the fault is mine because I was the one that set this problem in motion. I know that I will have to be the one who works out a solution, if you will let me.I hope that you will agree to try to save our relationship.",1

"We've spent so many memorable times together this year. Our love for each other grows each day. I don't know if I told you this already, but I really love everything about you. The way you hold me, the way we walk hand-in-hand, the way you lean your head upon my shoulder--every little thing you do makes me love you even more. I'm just so glad that I found someone like you; someone who's always there to make me happy, to make me smile, to brighten up my day. I feel that you're really the only one that I want to be with forever. I just want to share more happy memories with you. You know that I will love you forever and, whenever you need me, I'll always be there for you because I truly love you.",1

Yes, I do get lonely, but I think of how difficult it is for you there, and then I scold myself for being selfish.Please don't worry about me. I am okay. I want you to think only of taking care of yourself and of coming back home soon.I love you very much.",1
"Several weeks ago I received your invitation to join the ""Flower of the Month Club"" and to enter your sweepstakes. I declined the flowers offer, but returned the form qualifying me for a chance in the sweepstakes.Since then I have received monthly shipments of flowers, which I have returned marked ""refused, not ordered."" I have also received threatening letters telling me that I owe you over $85.00. I have sent you two letters (copies enclosed) explaining the misunderstanding and asking you to correct the problem. Today, I received a threatening letter from a collection agency, demanding payment for the flowers I returned.Since I have refused the flowers and have explained the situation twice before, I consider this to be harassment. I will not be bullied into paying for something that I did not order. If this continues I will take legal action rather than have you tarnish my good credit rating. ",0

"I must be honest. Before meeting you, I doubted the true existence of love. Amid the obstacles and competitions of daily life and the rapid and cold progression of facts and figures, love had grown to be more of a myth for me, something only written about and dreamed about. Love was something without real existence. I even started to imagine that people, out of the basic need to believe, had created the very concept of love itself. Someone had said that religion was the opium of the masses, but for me, love was that drug.You stripped me of these doubts, and made me realize that nothing--not the air, not the earth, not the sea, was more real than our love. I thank you for reviving me, for filling my life with hope and tenderness, and for reminding me of the purity of life and the purity of love. I am exhilarated by every ounce of you and by every moment we are together.I love you now, and I will love you always.",1
"The way you love me, I hope I can return it to your heart in the same way. Stay with me always, dear.",1
"I know that I have a very hard time expressing the way that I feel. You must know by now that I love you very much. When I think about you during the day, I smile. I enjoy you the most when we have moments where nothing else matters but us. I know that lately we have had a lot of external distractions and that those have placed a lot of strain on our relationship. Well, here goes my hesitation. I have to tell you that I love you, but that you do expect too much from me. I am not perfect. I need you to give me a break sometimes and stop insisting that I change. You want me to constantly say that I love you and you want me to say this in different ways. I find that hard to do.All that matters is that you chose me. Now you realize that I may have not been as perfect as you thought. I should outwardly show my love by being more romantic, but that is not my style. All I know is that I do care for you, and I hope that you can feel that I care by seeing that I want to be with you. Please don't expect me to behave differently. I love quietly from my heart and soul. This is the only way I know how. Please bend a little and accept my expression of love for what it is--a simple love from a simple man.",1
You are the perfect match for me and I know it from the first time I saw your beautiful face. Love you with my everything pretty girl.,1
"It's almost impossible to express how much I love you. How can I describe the beautiful emotions coursing through me, emotions telling me that our love was meant to be? The thought of seeing you, holding you, touching you, and kissing you--there's nothing on earth I would rather be doing.Words are often thought to be misleading, but right now, you must believe me: these words come from my heart, a heart you have deeply affected. I love you, and I will love for you for as long as I live. When you need me, I will always be there for you. You mean everything to me, and you take my breath away!",1

It means a great deal to be surrounded by people who truly care. I will always be grateful for your thoughtfulness. ",0

You are a pillar in the community and highly respected by everyone.Thank you once again for your powerful, well-thought-out recommendation. It means a lot that you would take time out of your busy schedule to help me succeed. If I can be of any service to you in the future, please don't hesitate to contact me. ",0
"Life is so unpredictable. Changes are always coming, big or small. I ask myself what is really special about you?It might be all the things I see on the surface, the things that everyone notices and admires about your qualities, talents, and wonderful smile so obviously connected to a warm and loving heart. These things set you apart from everyone else. And it might also be the little things--the way you walk, the way you talk, and every action. It gives me joy just to see a smile in your eyes. If I ever figure out the magic that makes you so special, I'd probably find out that it's a combination of all these things. You are a rare person. I find you really amazing!Inside me there is a place where my sweetest dreams reside, where my highest hopes are kept alive, where my deepest feelings are felt, and where my favorite memories are kept safe and warm. I find that you're on my mind more often than anything else. Sometimes I intentionally think of you just to make my day brighter. But more often, you surprise me and I find you in my thoughts. There are even times when I realize you've been a part of my dreams. Then during the day, when my imagination is free to run, it takes me into your arms and allows me to linger there, knowing there's nothing I'd rather do. I know my thoughts are reflecting the loving hopes of my heart because whenever they wander, they always take me to you.Only special things can come inside my heart and stay. And now, I realize how deeply my life has been touched by you.",1
Thanks for taking my advice so seriously. Those who learn from others' experience are usually a step ahead of the rest. Purchasing a home within your means now is a wise move. I'm sure you've done the right thing. You're young and will have time to purchase a larger home later. It's important to build equity now. It looks like you have a great future. ,0

"Having loved you well enough to give you my life when it was best work giving –having made you the center of all my hopes of earthly happiness — having never loved any human being as I have loved you, you can never be to me like any other human being, and it is utterly impossible that I should ever regard you with indifference. My whole existence having once had you for its sole object, and all its thoughts, hopes, affections having, in their full harvest, been yours, it is utterly impossible that I should ever forget this–that I should ever forget that you were once my lover and are my husband and the father of my children. I cannot behold you without emotion; my heart still answers to your voice, my blood in my veins to your footsteps.",1

"When did we decide that we wanted to be in a relationship? Or did it just happen? We seemed to get along and care for one another but then I began to feel hurt deeply and often. You criticized and made fun of me and I continued to wonder why and how did things change?And now you are gone and I wonder where you are in your feelings toward me? Do you regret how you mistreated me? I would never have imagined how much someone I once thought that I loved could hurt me.

My answer is that I need some assurance that you will try to change your behavior. If yes, please call me.",1

I need you here, but I know I can't have you again because we've wasted our love too many times.I'm sorry for the times I was so self-centered and never had the time for you, sorry for those words I told you that discouraged you, sorry for the times I wasn't with you. If I could be given the chance to show you again how I really feel, and if I could have you back, I would never leave you again. I would spoil you so that you would know that I really do love you, even though I'm so far away.Life still goes on for both of us. I wish you will find that perfect girl who could really love you and you could love in return. Maybe she will be taller, prettier, smarter, and funnier than I am, and everything you want from a girl. I just want to say, she will be the luckiest girl in the world to have someone like you.I really don't want to lose you, but before I have to say ""goodbye"" again, I want to say, ""Thank you for loving me for just a little while. I'm so sorry. I will always love you.""",1

"My will made by me, Laura Mary Octavia Lyttleton. I have not much to leave behind me, should I die next month, having my treasure deep in my heart where no one can reach it,  and where even death cannot enter… I want, first of all, to tell Alfred that all I have in the world and all I am and ever shall be, belongs to him more than anyone… So few women have been as happy as I have been every hour since I married – so few have had such a wonderful sky of love for their  common atmosphere, that perhaps it will seem strange when I write down that the sadness of death and parting is greatly lessened to  me by the fact of my consciousness of the eternal, indivisible oneness of Alfred and me. I feel as long as he is down here I must be here, silently, secretly sitting beside him as I do every evening now, however much my  soul is the other side, and that if Alfred were to die, we would be as we were on earth, love as we did this year, only fuller, quicker,  deeper than ever, with a purer passion and a wiser worship. Only in the meantime, whilst my body is hid from him and my eyes cannot see him, let my trivial toys be his till the morning comes when  nothing will matter because all is spirit.",1

"The first day we were introduced through the Internet, I knew you were the one for me. With our first hello and our first goodbye, I believe we both knew it. It has been a little over 2 years now, and we are still deeply rooted in each other's hearts, minds, and souls.Before we met, I had no idea what love really was and then my heart started aching for you. Now, each day we're apart, tears run down my face with longing to have you near me again. I never knew a man could have stolen my heart and made it truly his. I never knew I could love a man more than my own life until now.I long for the day I can finally look into your kind, beautiful eyes and tell you how much I love you and need you. The true beginning of my life will be when you are here in May. Seeing you every day will bring the greatest joy to my heart, knowing you are finally in reach of me. The very thought of you here excites me in a wonderful way.You are my every heartbeat, my every breath of life. What I need to survive and make it through this lonely world can only be conquered with you by my side. I do not think there are any words that could describe the way I actually feel about you. All I know is that you, dear, are the only man that is on my mind, the only man that is in my soul, the only man who truly and unconditionally has my heart for whatever lifetime this world has to offer us. When I think about you, my eyes start to tear up because I know you are somewhere else and not in my arms. But the thought of you keeps me going for another breath of fresh air and will keep me longing for you the rest of my life. I will never leave you, and I will truly never hurt you.I admire you. You are my inspiration for anything and everything worthwhile on this cold, damp earth. I never thought my time would come to love, and then it came, and I was hit with so much emotion and power I did not know where to put it all. I have stacked it, piece by piece, in my heart for you. I truly believe you are my soul mate, and you are the only man I will give all I have to offer forever. I hope you never let go of me because I love you, and I trust you love me too as much as I love you. Sometimes I need to think about you to make myself happy when I am down, and just the thought of you brightens my day completely. Picturing your smile makes me smile, and I cannot wait to see the beloved man I know with his unforgettable smile. I treasure you, and keep you locked in the big steel safe of my heart.

I know now what it is that I have, and that I've been given a second chance to hold onto it.The only thing that is important now is that we have a meaningful relationship.

"I was sleeping, yet my hand was searching for you, but you were not next to me. I turned my head and opened my eyes slightly to see you playing with your new computer, and I just smiled. As time went by, that would be so typical of me to do. I didn't know that you saw me sneaking glimpses of you. I turned my head to the other side and fell right back to sleep. Within minutes, I felt you beside me, only the terry cotton of your robe between us. I cuddled right up to you, like a puppy against his mother. I still wake up at times thinking of our first morning together when I smiled and you saw me and read my mind.",1
"Here are a few things I want to do with you as we go through life together:Walk together in the rain.Watch the sunset together.Stargaze together under a clear night sky.Spend all day together doing nothing.Take moonlit walks on the beach.Go on a carriage ride through Central Park.Do a crossword puzzle together.Have a champagne brunch and then go home.Go on a horseback ride at twilight.Have our picture taken together.Eat ice cream sundaes together.Make love passionately.Go to a museum together.Discuss current events in a heated debate.Carve our names in a heart on a tree.Ice skate or roller skate together.Give each other a backrub just because it feels good.Go hiking and camping together.Other things are too many to mention, except that I want to marry you!",1
"Love is the bright horizon on life's dark path. It shines in our faces and even sometimes blinds us, but we are fortunate that love exists at all. Love is the enchanter; it is magic. It can turn what was once a lonely life into a life with a one single breath that is suddenly worth living. Love can also find what was hopelessly lost and turn it into what is found and filled with joy. Love is filled with such wonder and magic, kind of like someone I know now!She is my reason for being, although I do not say it often enough. She is the kindest person I have ever known and probably ever will know. If she ran to the edge of the earth, I would be there to catch her before she fell. Our hearts are bound by love and magic for eternity. My love for her reaches to the furthest star in the universe, and there it has blossomed as light from the horizon on my darkest path. I love you.",1
"After eight years of working with some of the finest and most talented people in the industry, I have decided to move on and accept a position with Doe Corporation. I must admit that Jane's and my desire to be near our families in Kansas influenced our decision. I have asked John to assume my responsibilities until a replacement can be found. Business will continue as usual, but you will no longer be required to laugh at my jokes. I will greatly miss each and every one of you. My last directive is for Jane to organize and invite the entire group to a surprise going-away party in my honor. ",0
"True love begins as a friendship, but then quickly catches fire. It develops into mutual understanding, sharing, and forgiving. It proves to be loyal through both good and bad times. It settles for less than perfection and allows for human weaknesses.True love is content with the present, hopes for the future, and doesn't brood over the past. It's the day-in and day-out chronicle of irritations, problems, compromises, little disappointments, big victories, and mutual efforts toward common goals. If you have true love, it makes up for so many things you lack, but if you don't have it, whatever else you have is just not enough.When we met all those years ago, I soon knew you were the only one for me. Of all the people in this world, now you're the only one I run to for counsel and advice. I whisper your name when I wake up and hope I can see you every day before I dream of you every night. I know the love we enjoy is true love, so I know I will love you for the rest of my life.",1

"Since the first day you told me you loved me, I could hardly believe it. As each day passed and our love grew stronger, my mind did not lose the wonder of having you love me. You've stayed with me through all the ups and downs so far.I may not be the surest of men, always knowing what to do, or the right decisions to make, but I learn quickly. I want this to last. I don't want our love to burn out because of my mistakes. I believe God has sent you to me, and for that I thank Him from the bottom of my heart. You are truly a blessing in my life. You've taken my heart and wakened it from a deep sleep. I see how much you care, and I feel like I can fly. You are lifting my heart and inspiring it with yours, and it's the best feeling in the world.I sit here, thinking of you, and how I love you, and how you make my heart beat. I could never have thought that I would feel this way about anybody. I just love you so much. I don't know how it happened, and frankly I don't even care. I just want to have you in my arms again, to love you, and to have you love me. I promise I'll love you forever and never leave you.This may be starting to sound like a poem, I don't know; it must be the rhythm of my heart that's calling for you. I just want to tell you and the world that you are in my heart and in my every thought. I love you with everything I have and hold dear. You mean more to me than anything, and I miss you so much. You're probably sleeping now, but when you wake up, this will greet you. I'm pouring my heart out to you in this letter. Can you feel how I feel for you now, my one and only love? You mean the world to me. I'll always be faithful and never leave you.I've done what I've wanted for so very long now--I've told you how I truly feel about you. But once I press this ""send"" button, you will know how deeply I love you, my angel. I'll hold you in my heart forever.",1

"You have been recommended to me as a strong investor in local businesses. You may recall that we met at the Springfield Chamber of Commerce open house last month. I own ""Jane's Place,"" the restaurant on the corner of Center and Main.The opportunity has arisen for us to open a second restaurant in Centerville, near the Centerville playhouse. This is a most promising site, but this degree of expansion will necessitate our obtaining capital investment. The original ""Jane's Place"" is extremely popular with Springfield's young professional population, and I would like to offer you the opportunity to invest in what will almost certainly become Centerville's favorite after-theater gathering place. I expect this new restaurant will not only help to build the downtown area in a very positive way, but will also offer an excellent return on your investment.I would like to discuss this opportunity with you further.

"You know I love you. It has been almost a year that we've been apart and I still want you back. You must see that. You must realize that I can't give up on us. You were my first and only true love. I made so many mistakes. I shouldn't have been jealous. I see how I had nothing to worry about. I had you and my stupid thinking told me otherwise but my heart always knew you loved me and that you wouldn't leave me, but I had to mess everything up and my pathetic attempts to try and get you back. I tried to forget about you but it is so hard to stop loving a man like you. You're a smart, handsome, good-natured man who has a great future ahead of you, and I want to be a part of it. I believe in second chances no matter how much a person screws up and I screwed up big. I believe we are meant to be together forever and always.

Not seeing you often and knowing you are many hours, not minutes away, breaks my heart. I don't like the distance and just thinking of the many days before we see one another again makes me cry.I write this so that you can read it when you, too, feel lonely.

You are that someone, that special person that I could never deny my love for.

I need you in my life, my arms, my heart, and in my world.Can you stop and think about the question I am about to ask you very hard? I am asking for the opportunity to love you with all that I am now and all that I will be in the future. I don't want to continue living my life feeling empty and lonely any more.

"It's been nine months now since we called an end to our relationship and still you occupy my thoughts. At night, I toss and turn, trying so hard to forget you, then fall asleep and find you still there, haunting me in my dreams. I remember a time when I could not wait to go to bed and think about our times together. Now those sweet memories are nightmares which torment me.I wish that I knew the words that I could have said that would have kept you with me. If I could find them now, would it be too late? Have you moved on so quickly? I know time has passed, but for me it seems only yesterday that we were laughing and planning our lives together. I know you were scared, but so was I. You are probably scared still; I know I am. I wish I had you to comfort me. I wish I could also comfort you.There are so many things I wish I hadn't done and so many things I wish I had done. I wish I knew the words to tell you how I feel. I'm certain there is something I should have said. If I had found the words, I could be holding you instead of writing a letter.My mother always told me, ""If you find the one you think you're supposed to be with, don't let him get away. If you do, you'll regret it for the rest of your life."" I already regret. I loved you so much and still do. It wouldn't have mattered what we had to struggle through, we could have made it. Wouldn't the struggle have been better than separation? My heart tells me that it would have and I want to try.I miss you so much, Honey Bear. Please think about our getting together.",1

"From Day 1, I knew there was something in you that no other guy has. I had always searched for a blonde-haired, blue-eyed man, and dreamt of having a fairytale wedding. Well, you don't have blonde hair or blue eyes--but I think you're perfect! From your gorgeous smile to your warm, loving eyes and strong arms.I was scared to love you after everyone said we wouldn't even make it for two weeks, but we did, so what do they know? After we passed those first two weeks, I knew there was something that just worked between us. We made it through the best 10 months of my life, and then that's when you left. Now you are 2000 miles away and I can't be with you until June. Although these will be the hardest months of my life, I would wait forever to be in your arms again. Once again, we have people saying that there's no way we will make it through this, but I think we can prove them wrong once more.I live for you, and only you. I dream of the day that I can be your wife. I want so badly for that dream of mine to come true; you have no idea. When we talk about getting married and having kids together, my heart melts. I know that I'm young--younger than you--and you want what's best for me, but I know in my heart that you are the best thing that has ever and will ever happen to me.You have taught me so much about myself and the way that I should live my life. You have taught me things that will eventually help me grow into the type of person I need to be, and you have taught me to love without holding back. You have been my ""sweetest sin"" since the beginning.My parents didn't want us to last, some ""friends"" didn't want us to last, but you have no idea what it's like to be me when I get to feel your hands caressing my body. It's the feeling I get being that close to you, the feeling that I am the safest person in the world. I love you! You are the one for me, but you know that already, and I'll say this until I turn blue in the face: Marry me! You know I don't even mean right now, just some day! I love you!",1

Even with the distance between us, I realize more and more that we were meant for each other.When I met you for the first time, I thought I'd quickly forget you, but I was wrong. I still have your face painted on my heart and soul, and in my memory. Although a lot of time has passed since the first time I kissed you, I still have your kiss burning on my lips.Maybe I dream too much, but when I think of you I long to feel your touch, to whisper in your ears words only you would hear if you were mine. There is love so deep inside of me, my love, and in every part of me there is a part of you. You are everywhere that I am. Be certain that I will always be by your side, praying that you will always have a beautiful life.You are already the star of my life, my sky, and my ocean. I will always need you because I cannot live without air, without water, and without my soul, and you are all of this and more for me. I love you now and will always love you. My body still wants to feel you and your hug. I pray that this day will come soon, but if it doesn't, I will still be here for you and only you. All my kisses are yours, my love.

"After the two delightful evenings spent yesterday and the day before, I shall certainly not go out tonight, but will sit here at home and write to you. Besides, my Adele, my adorable and adored Adele, what have I not to tell you? O, God! for two days, I have been asking myself every moment if such happiness is not a dream. It seems to me that what I feel is not of earth. I cannot yet comprehend this cloudless heaven. You do not yet know, Adele, to what I had resigned myself. Alas, do I know it myself? Because I was weak, I fancied I was calm; because I was preparing myself for all the mad follies of despair, I thought I was courageous and resigned. Ah! let me cast myself humbly at your feet, you who are so grand, so tender and strong! I had been thinking that the utmost limit of my devotion could only be the sacrifice of my life; but you, my generous love, were ready to sacrifice for me the repose of yours. …You have been privileged to receive every gift from nature, you have both fortitude and tears. Oh, Adele, do not mistake these words for blind enthusiasm – enthusiasm for you has lasted all my life, and increased day by day. My whole soul is yours. If my entire existence had not been yours, the harmony of my being would have been lost, and I must have died — died inevitably. These were my meditations, Adele, when the letter that was to bring me hope of else despair arrived. If you love me, you know what must have been my joy. What I know you may have felt, I will not describe. My Adele, why is there no word for this but joy? Is it because there is no power in human speech to express such happiness? The sudden bound from mournful resignation to infinite felicity seemed to upset me. Even now I am still beside myself and sometimes I tremble lest I should suddenly awaken from this dream divine. Oh, now you are mine! At last you are mine! Soon — in a few months, perhaps, my angel will sleep in my arms, will awaken in my arms, will live there. All your thoughts at all moments, all your looks will be for me; all my thoughts, all my moments, all my looks, will be for you! My Adele! Adieu, my angel, my beloved Adele! Adieu! I will kiss your hair and go to bed. Still I am far from you, but I can dream of you. Soon perhaps you will be at my side. Adieu; pardon the delirium of your husband who embraces you, and who adores you, both for this life and another.",1

"I know that when two wayfarers ‘take shelter under the same tree and slake their thirst in the same river’ it has all been determined by their karma from a previous life. For the past few years you and I have shared the same pillow as man and wife who had intended to live and grow old together, and I have become as attached to you as your own shadow. This is what I believed, and I think this is what you have also thought about us. But now I have learnt about the final enterprise on which you have decided and, though I cannot be with you to share the grand moment, I rejoice in the knowledge of it. It is said that (on the eve of his final battle) the Chinese general, Hsiang Yü, valiant warrior though he was, grieved deeply about leaving Lady Yü, and that (in our own country) Kiso Yoshinaka lamented his parting from Lady Matsudono. I have now abandoned all hope about our future together in this world, and (mindful of their example) I have resolved to take the ultimate step while you are still alive. I shall be waiting for you at the end of what they call the road to death. I pray that you may never, never forget the great bounty, deep as the ocean, high as the mountains, that has been bestowed upon us for so many years by our lord, Prince Hideyori.",1

"Have you ever been caught in that one moment, that moment when, for the first time, the melody of life's sweet song is played in perfect harmony with your desires? As the chords play on, and as your mind moves with the notes, your body melts into the warmth of your emotions. Immersed in that moment, all that remains are a sea of crimson butterflies, their wings fluttering rhythmically to the beating of your heart. Just then, you wish you could capture that moment in time, for that moment creates a beauty as unique and wondrous as a yellow rose in a garden of violets. You wish that moment to be more than just a moment. More than anything, you wish it to be forever!With you, this moment is my every moment. When we kiss, or sleep, or talk--every hour that we are apart, I am lost--lost in this moment with you.",1

"I would have liked to have dined with you today, after finishing your essay – that my eyes, and lips, I do not exactly mean my voice, might have told you that they had raised you in my esteem.  What a cold word!  I would say love, if you will promise not to dispute about its propriety, when I want to express an increasing affection, founded on a more intimate acquaintance with your heart and understanding. I shall cork up all my kindness – yet the fine volatile essence may fly off in my walk – you know not how much tenderness for you may escape in a voluptuous sigh, should the air, as is often the case, give a pleasurable movement to the sensations, that have been clustering round my heart, as I read this morning – reminding myself, every now and then, that the writer loved me. Voluptuous is often expressive of a meaning I do not now intend to give, I would describe one of those moments, when the senses are exactly tuned by the ringing tenderness of the heart and according reason entices you to live in the present moment, regardless of the past or future – it is not rapture – it is sublime tranquility. I have felt it in your arms – hush!  Let not the light see, I was going to say hear it – these confessions should only be uttered – you know where, when the curtains are up – and all the world shut out – Ah me! I wish I may find you at home when I carry this letter to drop it in the box, – that I may drop a kiss with it into your heart, to be embalmed, till me meet, closer.",1

"It has taken me days to write this letter to you. Please read it with care and with the understanding that much thought went into it.I miss the way we were. With all my heart, I wish that there was some way we could go back to the days where your eyes beheld me as the most beautiful woman you had ever seen, when your heart felt lighter in my presence, when the thought of me kept you warm on a cold night. I still think about you this way.I know that I am the one mostly to blame for letting that light in your eyes die. I know that I messed up, that the things that I did were wrong, and I wish that there were something I could do to go back in time and change them. I know what it's like to be hurt the way that I have hurt you. It hurt me to see the pain that I caused you and not be able to do anything to make it better.Now here we are together again, but it doesn't feel the same. I know you still care for me--and even love me--but I wonder if you are ever going to forgive me for the past? How do we get past the hurt and the unhappy memories? Is it even possible? What can I do so that you will forgive me, to let me into your heart once more? Please let me earn back your trust and feel the fullness of your love again!I look back on all that I took for granted, and I only wish that I had appreciated it. I know that if I had it all back again, I would work harder to keep it this time. I wouldn't push it away like I did then. I would enjoy every moment I could bask in the beams of your radiant love. I want a chance to love you the right way this time, but I need you to give me a second chance. The distance between us tears at my heart. Please know, I have suffered for my sins, the greatest suffering I have ever known. I feel as though it is all my fault that I have lost you and your love. I am asking that you forgive me, please!I remember a time when we kissed each other for the shear pleasure of it. How we loved to be next to each other--HAD to be next to each other each waking moment. We couldn't wait until you were home again, and we were holding one another in a tight embrace. I remember the way we would lie curled up together with a pillow for each other, but sharing a blanket with each other. We had all we needed to feel safe, and warm, and happy. You are still everything that I need to make my life complete.As we were going down the road, my head was always on your shoulder as I snuggled up close to you. I smiled contentedly as you sang along with Tim McGraw on the radio. I miss you so much and all those simple, happy times we had together. I remember when we would pull over to the side of the road to look at flowers or to discover the stars on a clear, warm night as we lay in each other's arms. We couldn't resist one another in those days or the need to follow our desire to its climax.We've decided to stay together, I'm glad of that, but what I really want is the chance to do everything right, to make our relationship stronger and better than it ever was. I want the chance to prove that I've changed, that I can be trustworthy, honest, open, giving, and understanding. I know I have a lot to do before I earn back that trust, but I'd like the chance to try. Love is what makes the difficult easy, and the impossible possible. I know I may be asking for the impossible--to be forgiven.I long for the days when my touch affected you; made your heart race and your breathing quickened--when everything within you longed to pull me close. There was a fire in your eyes then, a hunger that I miss. Roses and candlelight may be fine for some, but romance is not what I desire, it is passion that I yearn for, passion that I feel I must have in my life--in your eyes. Time, hurt, and betrayal have erased that passion, but my desire for it is strong. I would do anything to feel desire burning through you as you take me in your arms.I look at you now with new eyes. I have a new appreciation for the wonderful things about you that once I took for granted, and the beauty of a face that reflects both the man I love and my dearest friend. No longer can I take you for granted, you are too important to me, too precious on every level--the man I love; the one whose love I once held in my hands. If only I had treated you right then, I know that I would be holding you still.The words of a song keep floating through my head: ""If ever you're in my arms again, this time I'll love you much better. If ever you're in my arms again, this time I'll hold you forever. This time will never end."" Even though you are in my arms, I know that you don't trust me with your heart yet. If ever I have the chance again, I would do everything so much better. But I'd like to know if that chance will ever come. Will you give me anything more than a reluctant reconciliation? I long for so much more. I need so much more. Maybe I have no right to hope for it, but I do.With regrets of the past and hopes for the future, I love you,",1

I wanted your love and you said that you did love me.Then you taught me that love doesn't last forever and that those you love can lie. And you left me. I sometimes wonder if I can stop loving you. The answer is that I can and that I will never again let anyone hurt me as you have. The feelings that I have for you seem still to be feelings of love. Perhaps they are, but they may also be feelings of sadness about what I had hoped we could be together.",1
Believe me when I say your love is more than a word I can spell. It's so real that I can't discard it. It's so precious that everyone wishes for it. It's so special that I can't get enough of it.,1
We know that you are busy during the summer months. You may have overlooked your first payment on the books you ordered. Please take out your checkbook while you have this reminder in your hand and write that check for $40 now. We look forward to your prompt payment. ,0
"At times I can't find the words to say what I mean, so writing it down when I think about it helps me to get my point across. All I know is that you are someone I want to spend time with and have fun with, someone I want to get to know better.I don't know quite what it is about you that is so special, but I hope in some way I make you feel it too. Being in a new relationship is always a little awkward to me at first. I guess I am a little shy and lack self-confidence. Since meeting you, though, I find myself smiling more often. I actually feel more cheerful first thing in the morning, which is a new thing for me.I love to talk with you. You come to the point quickly, but you're funny, too. We don't always agree on things, but that's what keeps it interesting.Anyway, I just felt like letting you know that I am thinking of you.",1
"On January 23 I had my 2018 Oldsmobile serviced in your Springfield Lubrication Center, and charged it to my Doe credit card. I have just received my credit card statement and notice that the charge appears twice on the same date. I remember the technician having problems with the computer, so I assume the double-billing was the result of some mistake at that time.I am enclosing a copy of my bill. I believe the best way to correct the problem would be for you to credit my card account with the amount charged for the service. If you will handle this problem immediately, I think everything will be okay. Thank you. ",0
Love has the power to transform the hardest of hearts; it has the power to heal and the power to comfort and redeem. I know this because I've seen what your love does to me.,1
"I just had to let you know that these last two days without talking to you have given me time to think about how I really feel about you. I have decided that I am definitely, hopelessly, in love with you. What made me realize this is not because I think about you all the time, although I do. It was how I think about you. Not only do I think about how much I love you, but why, how much, and mostly if I deserve you to love me.It feels so lucky to finally be able to love you like I have been wanting to for so long. Your sweet lips leave me speechless with each tender kiss. What have I done to deserve this? And that is another thing I was thinking. It is a little too strange, I think, that we are so right for each other. Some might want to argue about it, but I have a few examples to offer those poor, misguided souls. Your smile is like a world-famous painting. When we kiss, it is like two lost puzzle pieces finally found after a long search that make the picture complete. When we hold each other, time seems to stand still. When I look into your eyes, I see the love in your heart. All of this tells me one thing--our love is true and real.",1
"I never knew what true love was until I met you. From the first minute, I knew that you would be different from anyone that I had been with yet. And I was right. You were my first true love. I felt loved and loving when I was with you and, if I could rewind time, I would do a lot of things differently so we could still be together.You say that we can never be a couple. Well, in that case, I feel we both lost a true love. We had everything going for us right down to our families approving of our relationship. Have you thought about that? Even our friends thought that we could make it together and I would like to try one more time.If you would like to try, please call me. If I do not hear from you, well I guess I'll have to accept that I lost what was a true love.",1

"Thank you for extending me the offer of employment as the Director of Human Resources for the Doe Company. The opportunity to talk to you and the other executives has been enlightening and enjoyable. The company's growth plans are exciting and challenging.After considerable thought, I am concerned about the salary you offered. It is lower than I anticipated. Since I have had extensive experience in all aspects of the Human Resource functions (technical recruiting, compensation, employee relations, benefits administration, employment and organizational development), I feel I will be a great asset to you. My thorough knowledge of the numerous federal and state laws and regulations which affect the company will also aid you.I do want to accept this position but feel that we need to discuss the salary further. I will call in a few days to set up an appointment with you.Thank you again for the offer. I am sure we can reach an agreement. ",0
"After knowing you as my love, you now say that it's over and that you love me only as a friend and that breaks my heart. I would do anything to spend the rest of my life with you. I know that it wouldn't be easy to stay together, but life isn't easy. To think that you can change your mind about loving me is painful.That is why I can't stay; if I leave, maybe I can put my heart at peace, and my mind at rest. I will always think of you and carry the memories of the love that once was but now I have lost.",1

"Last year we over boarded 2,000 barking, mewing, and cawing guests. Maid service was exhausted. Springfield Animal Shelter has provided this humane service and has supplied affectionate companions to Springfield citizens for over twenty years. Our mayor, John Doe, adopted his jogging companion, Pepper, six years ago. Ashley Johnson adopted her tabby cat, Cleopatra, three years ago.Unfortunately, our ability to continue to match owners with pets is limited. This year we will be able to receive only half the number of guests we did last year, unless our resources double.

"Although we are apart, I want you to know that I still feel you with me. When I look out my window and see the stars in the sky, or when I watch birds land in a tree, I feel you with me. Though you may be far away, these same stars, this same sky, and these same birds--they are all part of your world as well. Across time and space, through air and water, we will share it all.I can't deny, though, that I miss you terribly. I miss your kiss and your embrace. I miss making love to you or falling asleep in your arms, but this period apart will pass. We must only remain patient and remember the depth of our connection and love. Soon enough, we will hold each other again, and we will build a life together.",1
"How I wish words could express the thoughts that I have about you. If I should say, ""I love you,"" then the greater percent of my feelings would still be unexpressed.

I had no idea we would be held up in the holiday traffic for so long. I have resisted buying a cellular phone, but today's frustration has convinced me that I must get one. I hope I can still have a chance to present my proposal to you and Mr. Doe. My sincere thanks for your patience and consideration. ",0

"It's hard for me to start this letter. After I talked to you last night, I thought everything would be fine, but when I woke up this morning, I realized that I had wished it was only a dream. I told you that I'm not happy anymore, partly because I wasn't, but the real reason I said it was because I wanted to feel I was still special to you, that you still loved me, because you have changed so much. Lately, I feel you've taken me for granted. I don't know if I'm just being paranoid, but I really miss your sweetness, your presence, your care. Last night, I wanted to hear that you didn't want me to go because you still loved me, but instead you answered me back with coldness and indifference. It really hurt me a lot. I realized I still loved you, despite your attitude. Love you so much.",1

He later developed many of the plastic products we now consider the backbone of our product line. His co-workers also recognize John for his courtesy and amicability.John's retirement is our loss, but a well-deserved respite for him.

I thought this might be a way of telling you, so that someday you can look back on this letter when you are feeling down and not forget what you mean to me, and how special you are to me.I know that we have had our share of problems, but what relationship doesn't? Please understand that loving you has changed my life forever. Each moment that you and I spend together is so magical that I catch myself smiling for no reason at all when I think about you. It feels so good to know that you accept me for who I am and that I can always count on you and trust you. There is a magic about you that attracts me to you like no one else can. You are so fun to be with, so interesting, and so irresistible. Whenever we are together, I feel so at ease and comfortable talking to you about everything and anything. I really enjoy being with you and sharing myself with you. The memories that I have of our relationship are everlasting; I wouldn't trade them for anything in the world.I want you to know how important you are to me and that I treasure every moment with you. Having you in my life has taught me the true meaning of love, and I have only you to thank for that. Our kind of love only happens once in a lifetime, and I know that I will never love anyone else the way that I love you.I want you also to know that you have become that special someone in my life, and I thank you for welcoming me into yours.

"It has been almost four months since I met that person online that truly took my heart away, but now it seems that it was more than that. Time flies faster and gets deeper and greater. We've continued communicating and fixed a regular chatting schedule once a week just to share each other's thoughts and dreams. We even manage to send e-mails and off-line messages. Once we've gotten a chance, we love to call each other whenever possible and that makes the relationship stronger, giving me the thoughts that it will definitely last forever, even if sometimes I think that distance would be of great hindrance and destroy us.I love the way you put in every effort that you can to make everything work out for us. The very thought that somebody like you would always be there to lend me some of his time just to make me happy and complete is amazing. I really appreciate it, even though there are times when I know things are getting rougher for you where you are. I am not sure how long you can be there for me, but I just wish it could be forever.You are my fantasy, my true love, and my dream. I am so scared that things will soon be over between us, and I'm not sure if I could handle that, because I am so used to having you in my life now. You make everything worthwhile, you make me believe in dreams and that they are really free and grabbing hold of them is only a matter of faith, persistence, and confidence.Thanks for everything. Thank you for giving me a chance to meet and love a dreamer that has been there for me for a long while. I am wishing I can always hold on to you and hope never to lose you and that we can make all our dreams into reality soon.",1
"I want to thank you for all the love, happiness, pain, and tears you have brought into my life. I always told you that you came into my life for a reason. And yes, it is true, you have taught me to love unconditionally, no matter how painful it was. I will always remember the love we shared, and the thought of it will always bring me a smile with no regrets, even though it brought me both joy and tears.You have strengthened my faith and brought me closer to God, as I always depended on Him because I was always afraid to lose you. I never really lost you, did I? I know you loved me--not enough to hold on to me but enough to love me for a short time. Although I was not able to behave properly with you, I am more cautious now and wiser.You hurt me; I can still feel the pain of every word you told me, especially when you weren't sure if you loved me or not. I used to ask myself, how could this guy who had once put sweet, loving messages on my answering system hurt me now so badly with his hurtful words. I loved you so much that when you pushed me away, I lost my self-esteem, my self-confidence, even my ability to think, so I realize what I felt for you was true love. You actually made me stronger when you hurt me this way. I did not say it was good for me to be hurt, but it was only because we shared true love that I could be so badly hurt.It is silly, but the tears you brought me cleansed my heart from all past hurt. I probably still might not be over what I've suffered in the past, but this experience made me a better person. I still cry when I think about you. I still have sleepless nights, still wake up too early, thinking of you. I still wish we could be together. I still wish you loved me, but I am a better person now, able to understand things better, not just from my point of view. I can better understand other people's emotions now, so I don't see how I could ever hate you. Thanks for bringing out the best in me, for all the joy, for giving me the best thing that ever happened in my life--YOU. I know it's not the end for me. I shouldn't be ever afraid to love again; I only need to be wiser.In my heart, you will always be more than just a sweet memory of the past or the love that once was, much more than that. I only walked away because you asked me too, because you thought it would make you happy, but my heart is never letting you go. There will always be a place in my heart for you, even though you have given up on us.I guess I will always love you. I will always love that simple man, the sweet you, the sensitive you, the affectionate you. And I will always miss your loving messages, your admiring glances, the sweet kisses, your strong arms, the feeling of being safe around you, your sweet smile, our long telephone conversations, and our late night dinners.I will always turn around when I see the same color van you drove, or see your letters in a license plate and stop, smile and think of you. I will always look back on the places we've been with that special joy in my heart. The time we spent was brief, but I loved every minute of it, and I will always cherish it.I thank God you came into my life and I love you and always will.",1
"The pain you have caused me is unbearable. I cannot sleep, I no longer eat; even breathing is difficult now. I wish things could be as they were in the beginning, but now I realize that is impossible. I have done nothing but insulted your intelligence and questioned your beauty, which I assure you is unlike anything I have ever witnessed. Your eyes shine with an amazing radiance, your smile is divine, and your image remains cemented in my mind. It is ironic, because you were my one and only true happiness, though at times you were my only sorrow.All I can ask for now is your forgiveness, though inside I yearn for so much more. I yearn for your gentle touch, to gaze into your mystifying eyes again, and to kiss your full red lips just one more time. If I had known things would have turned out this way, I would have done things differently. All of my immature insults would have been compliments instead.I can do nothing but apologize for my behavior. These feelings of love are so new to me. I have never felt for anyone what I feel for you. I have pushed you away, and spoiled my opportunity if, in fact, a chance ever existed. Maybe one day, our paths will cross again. If this wish is granted, all will be different. I will treat you how you deserve, and I vow I will never cause you any harm. Until then, I shall suffer the punishment I have dealt myself.",1

"Since management has refused to negotiate in good faith regarding changes in retirement benefits, we have no other recourse than to begin our strike at 12:01 a.m. Sunday, March 15. We will remain on strike until an agreement is reached that will not penalize the families of those who die before retirement.As difficult as a strike is on everyone, it is far more difficult for a family that is relying on a breadwinner's retirement to have it taken away. Our case is strong, and we hope to return to work soon. It is important that we show a united front in this issue that will affect many of our families. ",0
"There are no words to express how I feel about you. I constantly search for the right words, but they all seem to be less than what I truly feel. You are my life, my heart, and my soul. You are my best friend. You are my one true love. I still remember the day we first met. I knew that you were the one I was meant to be with forever. As the years went by, and we drifted apart, I still held onto the memory of you. I thought of you every day, and dreamed of you every night. Just when I thought you had forgotten me, you called and made all my dreams come true again. The sound of your voice on the phone was the sweetest sound I ever heard. That day you called and told me we might have a chance to make it all right again, my heart started beating within my chest, my hand shook holding the receiver, and I could barely breathe. When you came out to see me, and I knew it was meant to be-those were the sweetest days, those memories of the past. It all went by so quickly. I wanted it to last.The day you left, I thought I would die. Then you called again, and I heard your voice on the line. I had to be near you, to hold you again. I needed to show you that you were the best. So I made the decision to tell you how I felt. When you said you felt the same, I felt it was a dream. I packed my stuff and changed my life forever. I never looked back because now you will make me your wife. I am on a cloud, living in a dream, and a few days from now, it will really feel real. I wrote this letter for you to keep and, when you need a reminder of how we felt on those happy days, it will remind you. I've said it before and I'll say it again, words cannot really express how you make me feel. I make this promise to you, my dear: I will always love you the way I did in the beginning. I now look to the future and forget the past, hoping that your love will always be mine and that we can make it last. I love you more today than I did yesterday, and I'll love you more tomorrow more than I do today. With all my heart, I am forever yours.",1
"It has been a long time since we met, don't you think? I can't believe how long I loved you and still contained my love!Your beautiful eyes and the sweet smile you gave me melted my heart away. I wish I could have given your smooth cheeks a kiss as soon as I met you. Now, whenever I see your face, my knees go weak, my heart throbs when I feel you near me. Your body is perfection, but it wouldn't matter to me anyway.I loved the way you looked at me yesterday. Thank you for the smile you gave me. My mouth dropped open, but I would have stuttered if I had tried to speak. I couldn't say anything; I just stared at your natural beauty. I wish I could have had the courage to do so because you're the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I have been praying to find someone like you for several years now, and I hope I'll be able to talk to you soon. I just don't have the courage right now.I hope we could go out together one day, and I could pour out my feelings to you. Even if you don't love me, I'll always wait for you and hope. No matter what, you are in my heart, no matter what happens. I hope that some day I'll be able to hold you in my arms and tell you that I love you. I will always love you--and that's a promise!",1

"Baby, I miss you so much! It seems like forever since I saw you last. Every day now is just like the one before. I sit around just thinking about you, wishing you were still mine. The thought that you belong to somebody else is too painful to bear.I wonder sometimes if you tell her that you love her and that she is the perfect girl, like you once told me. Do you tell her the stories that you told me? And the song, ""Unanswered Prayers,"" do you tell her that it reminds you of her?Maybe someday we will find each other again and appreciate each other more. You are the love of my life, and I know you still love me too. Good-bye for now. I love you.",1

"Eight days have passed since I parted from f.f., and already it is as though I had been eight years away from her, although I can avow that not one hour has passed without her memory which has become such a close companion to my thoughts that now more than ever is it the food and sustenance of my soul; and if it should endure like this a few days more, as seems it must, I truly believe it will in every way have assumed the office of my soul, and I shall then live and thrive on the memory of her as do other men upon their souls, and I shall have no life but in this single thought. Let the God who so decrees do as he will, so long as in exchange I may have as much a part of her as shall suffice to prove the gospel of our affinity is founded on true prophecy. Often I find myself recalling, and with what ease, certain words spoken to me, some on the balcony with the moon as witness, others at that window I shall always look upon so gladly, with all the many endearing and gracious acts I have seen my gentle lady perform–for all are dancing about my heart with a tenderness so wondrous that they inflame me with a strong desire to beg her to test the quality of my love. For I shall never rest content until I am certain she knows what she is able to enact in me and how great and strong is the fire that her great worth has kindled in my breast. The flame of true love is a mighty force, and most of all when two equally matched wills in two exalted minds contend to see which loves the most, each striving to give yet more vital proof… It would be the greatest delight for me to see just two lines in f.f.’s hand, yet I dare not ask so much. May your Ladyship beseech her to perform whatever you feel is best for me. With my heart I kiss your Ladyship’s hand, since I cannot with my lips.",1

It is a love that is strong and enduring and will stand the test of time. I truly feel blessed that you have become a part of my life, and I cannot wait for the day that we can join our lives together.

I need not tell you about the importance of a single second now, either, because we have tasted the sweetness of a heavenly moment and the bitterness of when it's not long enough. I need not tell you how hearts can break and how they are mended, because we mended each other's broken hearts when we first met.I need not tell you about fear, because we have seen it move through us in many forms and through many layers. I need not tell you how it moves or how long it stays, because we don't always know. I need not tell you about longing, because we have heard its screams in the dead of the night. I need not tell you about stillness, because in the stillness we've known has been the deepest, most powerful silence. I need not tell you about power, because we know that power is not in strength, but in truth and in knowing, but most of all in loving. I need not tell you about our love because true love is what has grown from the inside and finally has shown in each other's eyes.Nobody needs to tell us anything now, because we know everything!

That feeling grew even stronger until I found myself longing for you. I thought it was only a fling between two lonely people who needed special affection, caring, and attention; however, it's become more as the days have gone by. I fell in love with you. Your kindness, warmth, sweetness, respect, and trust in me was there until last Friday when you shut me completely out!

"This year's fundraising campaign has resulted in significant public response, and we are very grateful to the people who've helped us achieve this success. We still have some distance to cover before meeting our financial goals, however, and although the fundraising period is drawing to a close, we feel that one last push for exposure would draw the final response we require.Therefore, if you have not distributed the previously sent fundraising materials, now is the perfect time to do so. Please identify your best neighborhood restaurants, cafes, and stores and distribute the fundraising materials within the next week. Your participation is an essential element of our drive to raise the funds for a new shelter and soup kitchen in the (Name of Neighborhood) neighborhood of our city. We sincerely appreciate your vision and support. ",0
"Thank you for your order of three silk flower wreaths from Doe's Blooming Business. The wreaths should arrive within three days of your receiving this confirmation. You will find two wreaths with mauve hues and the third with copper tones, just as you specified. On the copper wreath, I took the liberty of replacing the background rhododendron with a variegated fern since the fern colors complemented the wreath much better.If you are unsatisfied, alert me and I'll send you another one immediately. The total bill for all three wreaths is $567.98. Payment in full is due within 30 days. Thank you for your patronage. I sincerely hope you are satisfied with the products. If you are interested in swags with colors that complement your wreaths, I would be delighted to fill your order. ",0
"I was afraid to fall in love so I kept up my guard. I was afraid to be dumped or used, but you showed me what true love is. You had been loved and left before, too, and I know that you were as scared as I was to get involved.I know I have done some things to hurt you, and I am really sorry. But now both our lives seem empty without one another. I know now how much I love you and I want you back.I want the house, the careers, the trucks, the kids, the animals, and the whole nine yards. My love for you continues to grow, and even though I will be gone for awhile, it will never fade. You are my one true love, and I hope you will be there for me. I trust you and love you with all my heart and soul. You are everything to me.",1

"When we first met, I didn't even consider that you were real. You were just a pixel on a screen. We talked more, and then I became confused. ""How I could I have real feelings for a person I've never met?"" I'd ask myself. Since then we have met. I will never forget the first time I looked into your eyes, and it was at that very moment I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. In your eyes, I saw everything I needed to know. It's been seven months now. Things have not been easy. We've had our ups and downs but, through it all, I do know what we have is so very real.",1

Your help will be greatly appreciated. ",0
"Yesterday I received the book I ordered from the Doe Book Club and found pages 20 to 35 missing. Because the book is damaged, I am asking that Doe credit my account with 50% of the book price--$8.50 to be exact. In my two years of business with the Book Club I have never received an inferior product. I feel certain that Doe could not sell this book as-is for the regular asking price. Because I have already read the novel, I am willing to accept the book at a discount rather than return it for a full refund. If I receive no reply within two weeks, I will return the book for full credit plus shipping charges. ",0

"Harold Walfield's retirement is upon us. The date we have feared, yet anticipated for years, is June 1. When Harold joined the company in 2012, he doubled the number of employees on the payroll. He went on to more than double our revenues by adapting new technologies from the big machine works for use in our little shop. Since he was made partner in 2016, Harold's leadership and innovation have kept us ahead of all our competitors, both locally and nationwide.

You are the best thing that has ever happened to me, and every night I wish upon a star for you to return to me again.

Hopefully, when that day comes, I will still have you by my side and your angel face will be the last one that I see.

I am really tired and trying hard to sleep, but I just can't sleep. You are always on my mind, and I'm going crazy because of you. If you were lying by my side, the longest night would pass peacefully.Your ignorance of my love for you is making my heart ache, and it's broken into pieces that can't be mended. I wish I could go back to the very first day I met you. I shouldn't have moved when you looked into my eyes. I knew you were trying to tell me something, because now I feel the same way too. Deep inside my heart I wanted to tell you, even then, that I loved you.I love you now, too. It doesn't matter if you don't feel the same way, as long as you know I will love you always. No matter what or how, I wish to be with you all my life and into the next one.",1

Sometimes I do silly things to make you laugh and feel happy so that you would know that I care for you.Ups and downs are a part of life. You shared each and every part of your life with me as I did with you, so why do we quarrel? It frightens me. Why do we hurt each other's feelings? We promised not to let any tears come into each other's eyes. You are a part of my soul, a part of me, and I feel that I am a part of you.I love you and want to be with you.",1
"Upon the recommendation of our search committee, we have offered the position of Director in Hematology to Dr. Jane Doe. She has accepted the position and will take up her new duties with us April 14. We are keenly aware of the important service you have given while this position was vacant. Without your willingness to step in temporarily, I don't know how we would have kept the ship afloat. Thanks to your selflessness and expertise, we averted serious problems that would otherwise have attended last winter's unexpected vacancy in this position.Dr. Doe comes to us from a two-year post at the Springfield Medical Park, where she is known for her scholarship, her professionalism, and her personable manner with patients and colleagues.

I wonder how you can be sure that this does not work for you.I would like to have another chance. If I never get another chance, I want to thank you for allowing me to share some great times.",1

"I never thought you would be back. It never occurred to me that I would even see you again. But there you were, talking and laughing to me and being comfortable, as if nothing had happened two years ago. Why in the world have we even met again?I don't want to ask for anything more than this. I just want this to last, even if it will result in just being friends. Just being in touch with you again, without promises, is more than enough. Remaining friends is enough for me to feel certain that I will have a connection with you again. I will know what is happening in your life, and you will know what is happening in mine. We are enjoying a good relationship again, and that is all that I need right now.",1

It is truly a blessing that I found you. I want you to know that with every moment, my love for you grows stronger and deeper.Honey, I never knew I could be this happy. It is the greatest feeling in the world to be this happy and content, and I have found it all with you. No one else has ever made me feel the way you make me feel. Your caress, your kiss, your touch, your words, your understanding ways--everything about you means the world to me and none of this could ever be replaced.Sometimes I feel like I start to bother you, but we seem to overcome all our problems, and we are still together. We have had good times and bad times, but the good ones surely make up for the bad ones. That is what is most important. I pray we will always be together.

"It has been the most amazing five months of my life and I've experienced things I have never known before. We have come a very long way and stuck by each other's side through a lot of painful moments. You have shown me what it is like to love and be loved, and that's given me happiness. That's all I need to have the most amazing life I could ever have, and I have you to thank for it.To be mature, you usually have to be an adult who has lived a certain number of years. But to be in love, you only have to be a human being with a heart. Parents shouldn't try to prevent their children from falling in love with someone because of their age or for some other reason. You can't really stop love from happening, and you can't put your feelings on hold because someone is telling you to. I love you, and I can't stop my feelings or wait until my mom thinks it is okay to love you. You are everything to me, and I can't give you up willingly. I don't think I can live if living is without you.Honey, you are one of a kind and are the most amazing person I've ever known. You understand me and care about me more than anyone else has ever done before. You are so caring and wonderful. You are beautiful. We have a healthy relationship that is going to last a lifetime because you and I are willing to work out anything that needs to be worked out. We communicate and, even if sometimes it's hard to tell each other our feelings, we still understand each other by looking in each other's eyes. We have our love songs, too, and those lines that just seem to fit us like, ""It's just a matter of trust."" It plays over in my head every time I think of you or, ""Sometimes all I need is the air that I breathe and to love you,"" whenever I hold you.We are going to have an amazing family and an amazing life ahead of us. I know now that what we have is so very true because it feels so right. Those beautiful eyes glow whenever I look at you or our eyes meet, and my whole being feels electrified. I wrote this letter to you from the bottom of my heart--from my heart to yours. I love you and will forever.",1

"I am writing as a private citizen and outdoors person to urge you to vote against the Doe Bill coming before Congress this fall. This bill will decrease the already scant enforcement of laws regulating timber sales on public land in the upland areas of our state. In addition, it allows the timber companies less accountability to the people for the damaging methods of harvest they employ in sensitive areas. I have seen illegal clear-cuts, and I have seen slash burns destroy thousands of acres of wilderness, with no restitution made to the ultimate losers, the public. Big Timber may have the money now to support this legislation, but with the opposition of forward-thinking public servants like you, we can work toward balanced, long-term solutions to our land use issues.

"You came into my life not too long ago, and I didn't think too much of it. We were friends and we got along well, but I never imagined I'd be falling so hard for you. The more I got to know you, the more often I wanted to be with you. You always made me smile, and without you I was very different. You changed me in so many ways. I wanted to wake up in the morning to see what life was going to throw at me each and every day. After we became closer and were talking all the time, you told me you had to leave. You had to go back home, and you couldn't stay any longer.That night I thought about telling you what lay within my heart, but I decided not to. Your friendship meant so much more to me. You are coming back to visit soon, and I can't help but think about you all the time now. Every morning when I wake up, then during the day, and before I go to sleep, you are always on my mind and even in my dreams. I wish you knew how strongly I felt and that I am falling in love with you.One day I will tell you, but for now I will only see you in my dreams and hold you close to my heart. I love you so much.

Ultimately, the increased savings will lead to higher tax revenues in spite of what the opposition would have us believe.

Once again we are turning to our supporters for donations to finance our young singers' European tour. They have worked hard to prepare several songs in French, German and Spanish, and are adding three new instrumental numbers to their repertoire.The choir members and their parents are sponsoring their annual fund-raising barbecue on Saturday, May 3, at 6:00 p.m. in the Springfield Park.

Even now, a year after we parted, I still care about you and love you, no matter what. We have formed memories for each other that no one else could ever replace. At least we've carved special memories in each other's hearts in which we were the other's first love.If we could travel back in time, I would seek for every opportunity to hold on to you and not lose you. I would follow you no matter where you went, I would swim the deepest ocean, climb the highest mountain. I love you.",1

"Tonight I write about my love for you. I know that in the course of our five years together, we have been back and forth, and in an out, but yet, through it all, we still hold on--holding onto a dream that one day we will be happy together again, the way we were before.I know people often dream about a love like ours; that's why I try to hold on to it. To ease my mind I need to know why do you still hold on? I cannot change the past, only work towards the future. I see in my future you and only you. You are my sunrise and sunset--my whole being of myself, living only for you. You make my rainy days seem happy and my sunny days something to look forward to as I wake each day. I know I'm not perfect and maybe I'm a little rough around the edges, but I know that I can be all you want, desire, and need in a woman.We created a lovely baby, made completely out of love. Every day I look at her, she reminds me of the love we once held so dear. The day you packed your things and left, a part of my heart broke through the endless tears and not knowing what is to become of us. It really has me afraid that this time, the end may truly be the end.I am thankful we keep trying, for you are the most important person in my life, and nothing will ever change that, my soul mate. I love you so deeply that even words cannot express them clearly enough.",1

We can save much more if we can meet our goal of doubling last year's donations.We formed the Doe Wetlands Coalition in 1988 to help counter the astonishingly swift destruction of the Midwestern wetlands, which serve as home to over 300 species of birds.

They had a shine I had never seen before, and I thought to my self that's an angel. I felt my heart skip a beat and I felt breathless, too. I crossed the road to the other side where you were and said hello. But when I talked to you, I knew right then and there that you really were an angel. From that moment on, I knew you were the one.

That time I would have a better understanding of what needs to be done and what makes you happy. We are only human, though and, as humans, we can't do that. The next best thing that can be done is to let me do what I would do if I had that other option now.

When you are happy and you smile at me, my heart melts, and I wonder how I could be so lucky as to find someone so wonderful to love and who would love me, too. When you are sad, my heart breaks, and I want to do whatever is in my power to make you smile your beautiful smile in return. When you are upset with me, my heart aches, and I can think of nothing but how I regret whatever it is I may have done.I desperately need your love and your affection, and I feel that without it I would shrivel up into nothing and disappear. You are so beautiful. You are so beautiful. I look in the mirror and wonder how someone like you could want me. You are all that I could ever want--partner, friend, and lover. You are amazing, wonderful, sexy, beautiful, playful, alluring, sensual, loving, caring--undeniably the most perfect person I have ever met or that could ever be. I can't imagine where I would be or what I would do without you in my life.I look back on the day that I told you was serendipity. Meeting you has made me believe in fate. We were meant to be. Now and forever we belong to each other. After loving you, I could never want anyone else. I hope we will happily travel through our lives together until we are that perfect middle-aged couple people, good-naturedly making jokes at each other's expense, only to laugh, then go upstairs and make love.I love you so much that these words cannot begin to express the emotion. There are no words that can really express how I feel about you and how truly and deeply I love you.",1

"I don't know what happened to me, whether I was crazy or just lonely. All I know is I was sick of being deceived, mistreated, and unappreciated. Then you came along, I don't know why. All I know is that I felt a connection on our first chat, something I had never felt before that at first made me feel uneasy, stupid, and even a bit childish. It put me go through all kinds of emotions as we chatted on line and I began finding we had a lot in common. I felt like we knew each other from an unknown past.At first I was scared, and a part of me wanted to believe that you were just someone who was playing a game. I was thinking I was crazy to have the feelings I was beginning to have for you. I was really upset with myself and became very angry with the way I was feeling. I didn't want to admit to you or to anyone else that I was falling for someone I had never actually met. I thought I was becoming insane myself. I tried to fight these feelings off, but they were just too powerful for me to ignore! I tried to convince myself that this can't be for real; that you couldn't REALLY be feeling the same as I was. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't fight the feelings I was having for you.Then the night came when you expressed how you were beginning to feel that which I tried not to believe, because I was scared of being disappointed. The magnetism that I was feeling was so strong, though, that I could no longer fight it. Our chats became an every day thing, and the feelings just wouldn't go away, no matter how hard I tried to ignore them.I just could not resist the temptation of meeting you while I was on vacation near you. All along, I could not believe you were for real, but when we finally first met, I knew there was no way I could stop loving you. I thought that if we met, these feelings would just go away, but they didn't. I tried so hard to convince myself that there is no such thing as true love, but you have made me believe differently.We have been together for nearly nine months now, and I still love you and even more so now. You have become a part of me that I will always cherish. I love you with all my heart, forever and always. You have brought me so much happiness.",1

We faced many trials and circumstances, but we surpassed them all. Now, however, things are pretty black. I don't know went wrong. Do you?Now it's time for me to say goodbye.

"Thank you for coming into my life. The day I wanted to end my life because he left me, you came to tell me that life must go on. You were sent to be my angel. Thank you for everything, for all your sacrifices.I miss those times when you called me ""Honey Bunch."" When I was exhausted at the end of the day and called you, you were always there to listen to my troubles. You have been my inspiration; you helped me achieve my dreams. But now, they've all fallen apart.I know I'm not the kind of woman you dreamed of, I don't have the perfect body, but still you loved me for who I am. I remember you once told me, ""It doesn't matter if you can't love me too."" If you only knew, Baby, you were my life, my friend. If you only knew how happy I was to have you, and how my life fell apart when I lost you.I know that I've hurt you so many times and that I shouldn't be bothering you now. I know that I said, ""Let me go,"" but still here I am asking for another chance. Things really changed when you left. My life started to lose direction. I must admit, I can't move on now.I kept on blaming myself because it was my entire fault. I've been too selfish, too hard on you. Now I'm starting to realize that you were too good for me. You are a very good man, and you deserve someone better than I am. I tried to change for you, but my efforts were not enough. I hope somehow that I made your life special, anyway, though I've not been perfect for you. I hope you'll be happy now and that you can find the person whom you truly deserve.If you really decide to let go, then there's nothing I can do. I know ""sorry' is not enough for the things I have done, but I hope my sincerity is enough. I regret the foolish things that I have done. Because of those things, I lost you, I lost my life. And I'll never love again because of that. But if you can give me another chance, I swear this time I'll make sure I won't hurt you and never, ever let you go.Even if it will take me a lifetime, I will wait for you to come back. I would not want another love. I'd rather be alone than be with someone who could never take your place.We've done our best to make our relationship last longer, but things happened and we had to say ""goodbye."" This goodbye would not mean forgetting our memories; they are too special to forget. It does not mean forgetting the things in our past that made us both better individuals. Maybe we had to say ""goodbye,"" but I want you to remember this--you will always have a special place in my heart. I consider myself lucky to have experienced a love as wonderful as ours. For the last time, I love you.",1
"Through the turmoil of almost 10 years of our life together, our love has persisted and overcome all obstacles. Both of us have weathered crises that have struck us together and apart. Until now, that is, when the true test of love and partnership will have to be made.I still gaze into your eyes and touch your soul without a word as you do to me. I still thrill to your touch and the tender caress that is now infrequent. All the confusion is cleared away when our hearts open wide to receive the warmth of each other's love and our tenderness toward each other arouses our physical feelings. Although our spirits are now divided, yet they merge in the cosmos, and both of us still feel what the union of the lion with the scorpion can be, the intensity and fulfillment of life's dreams.The time is now; the choice to love is ours.

I feel that if I could get myself remade, as if turned to gold, I WOULD not even then desire to become more than the mere setting to that diamond you must always wear.

Of all the people I have met, you were the only one for me, the only one that I wanted to spend my life with. I know I threw everything away by not cherishing you, and I know I don't deserve to ask you to come back now, after all that I have done.

"Why did you leave me? Was she that much better that you wanted to hold her and not me? What made you decide that you were not right for me?You once held me when my world seemed empty. How could you leave me so suddenly? You broke my heart. You left me with only memories. I will never forget the time you kissed my hand, and I kissed you back so our pain would go away. But now there is another girl. Who is going to be there for me now to kiss away the pain you have caused? If you are moving on then I am too. If you want to think twice, call me.",1
"Although sometimes I question things, deep inside I know that you are the only one for me. When I'm not with you, you are the only one that's on my mind. Everything about you tells me that we can be together forever. Only you can make me feel like time stops when we're together. Only you can make things better when I'm feeling pretty miserable. Only you can smooth my fears away. For this I'm grateful, and I hope you'll never leave me. I love you.",1

"Never did I think it was possible for one person to hurt another so badly. I never wanted this for us. I know we could have been great together. I know that I would have stayed with you for the rest of our lives. I gave you chance after chance, but you threw every one out the window. I wanted nothing but the best for you. I loved you so much.I remember in the beginning how you treated me like a queen. That changed as you became more critical and hurtful. You once were everything to me and now we can't be together without my feeling hurt. It's not that I don't want you; it's because I can not be with you if you do not change your behavior.I want you to know, though, that I will always remember you as the one who taught me how to love with my whole being. I know this will be hard on you now. It's hard on me too. I hope one day you'll understand why I have to do this. If you agree to get help, call me.",1

"It has almost been one and a half years since I had the honor of holding you in my arms, and it has been one and a half years since we looked into each other's eyes and said, ""I love you.""What started out as a sincere friendship turned into a strong bond between two lovers who found out the true meaning of love the hard way. The journey seems so long, sometimes, and at the same time it seems so short. To me it feels like time is purposely bending and stretching itself so that it can play its part in making us feel the joy and pain of what it is to truly be in a long-distance relationship. All I know is, as time goes by, I learn a lot from this love, and I have learned what it is like to give myself completely to another person when the two of us are so far apart. The most important thing I learned, among many important things, was to trust and to be faithful to the one I love.I just got done chatting with you on the Internet after you had signed on to say ""good night,"" but in my heart I did not want to do that--say ""good night,"" that is. I just wish that time had frozen that short time before we had to say those words. I enjoyed every single moment with you, and how we talked about all of the things we liked and disliked. Tonight you told me how you liked the music CD your brother bought for you, and you asked me what music groups I liked, too. I really wish I could have been there to hear that music with you.I am sitting here in my room and writing this message now, hoping you will get to read it when you come back from work later if you go online, but if not, then at least I know this letter will reach you sooner or later. I am listening to some love songs that I burned onto a CD I'm making. Although I don't understand the words because the songs are in Spanish, I know that they are about love, and I like them a lot. I really don't understand how my love works, but all I know is that the love I have for you is just like the Spanish music I am listening to now. I know that my life is much happier when you're around me and that my life is filled with music just thinking about you.I want to let you know that I am so in love with you, and I have learned a lot from this relationship. I promise you that I will do my best to make you feel loved and secure, even though there are thousands of miles between us.Thank you for making my life so much more meaningful and giving me this chance to tell you what love means to me. I know that I am supposed to go to sleep soon, but there is so much more I want to tell you, and I am still so wound up. Being away from you is so hard for me because it is like giving up a part of my life that is essential to me.I have built my world around you, and I really like the world that we have built together. I always want to stay in that world and never want to leave it, and I hope that you feel the same way, too.Now is the hardest part for me to do. I have to say ""goodbye"" and ""goodnight,"" because I need to go to sleep soon. But I know that as soon as I close my eyes I will be there with you, and it makes me so happy again. I love you with all my heart, and I want you to know that I really miss you. Please take care and have a nice day tomorrow. May you feel me wanting to be with you now, and may I touch your heart and let you feel my love. Take care, Lisa, and know that I am sending all my love to you across the miles.",1

"I am so proud of the person you've become. You inspire me. I understand you've been through a lot and neither one of us have always made the best choices, but I believe we both have grown. I've always known from the very first time I met you that you were a stronger person than I.You are so full of wisdom about life that when you talk, I could just listen forever. Your open mind is wise and comforting. You have helped me see things in a brighter, happier, more enlightened way. I was drowning from my own fears and was completely cynical about love, hope, and security. I used to think that no one understood me or could ever truly love me.When I got to know, I realized I wasn't alone. I knew that something inside of you was hurting too. I went through a time in my life when I felt worthless and unloved, and I continuously searched for happiness. This year you became my survival. I don't think I could have made it without you.I thank you for all the fun times we spent together even if they were short-lived. I have come to the conclusion you are an angel sent by God to help me see the light. Clouds of darkness shadowed over me, but you make me smile with just your presence. You are my angel, and I thank you once again from the bottom of my heart. Please know you will always live in my heart and I will continue to hope that we can be together soon.",1
"We met almost four years ago, and my life hasn't been the same since. You began as my friend, someone I could talk to, laugh with, someone who was always there for me, even when there were gaps because one of us had left for a while. Somewhere in the past 2 ' years, though, I fell in love with you and, ever since then, I've always been waiting here for you, but waiting for you to realize I am here, and that all you have to do is ask, and I'd be there with you. Instead, I sit back and watch you become unhappy because you are alone, all because the one you love now can't--or won't do--something to make you happy.We've not talked for a long while now, so I'm afraid I've lost you and honestly don't know how I'm going to handle losing you. I cannot bear thinking of a life without you in it. I know there is going to come a time--and my heart is telling me it's now--that I'm going to have to say goodbye to you, but I cannot bring myself to do it. Since I've fallen in love with you, I've tried to get over how I feel about you, but I just can't. It always come back to hoping you will realize my love for you and fall in love with me too, if only you'd give us a chance. I love you and will always be here if you need me, just don't make me say goodbye.",1
"I am so glad to be loved by someone as special as you are. I thought for a long time that nobody could ever make me happy and win my hardened heart until I met you. You've really changed my life and I thank God I am loved and cherished by someone like you. You brought a sweet love into my life.I love you so much. You mean more than anything in this world to me. I thank God I found you, and I will do my best to keep your sweet love in my life.",1

Please call to arrange a time when I will be home. I trust this matter can be resolved very quickly, so I can get my files organized soon. ",0
"When I saw you last, you asked me to keep an eye open for the right kind of tour guide to work out of your public relations office. As you put it, ""I'm looking for a geologist with a broad smile."" I thought I'd drop you this quick note to tell you about a charming new student of mine who fits the bill perfectly.His name is John Doe. A rock hound since childhood, he has impressed professors here at the university as one of the most diligent graduate students to come through our program in years. His affable manner suits him well for work in public relations. Just last week I had the good luck of working shoulder to shoulder with John in the field on an extended trip, and I can vouch for him as the kind of fellow you want to have along on long shifts or in cramped quarters. I believe he could brighten up even the dankest coal shaft with his good humor alone. I thought I first ought to let you know just who's sending him your way, so I suggested he call you at your office sometime after the weekend. I'm curious to see if your impressions of him don't match my own. Please let me know if you still need me to keep looking. I'm happy to be of help. ",0
"Your heart and soul carry a beauty I've found in no one else. Your warmth and compassion inspire me to go forward and take new risks daily, refining me into a better person.

"If only I could have come up with the right words to describe the depth of this beautiful feeling that I have for you, I would have uttered them to you the first time I laid eyes on you. But I lacked that knowledge, so the best thing that I can do is to show you how I really mean it now. I love you so dearly. Did you know that? You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. You are like the best poetry ever composed, the best song ever played, the best picture ever painted. I never thought or expected that someone like me could get so lucky as to find you. How could I have known the comfort and security that comes whenever I say ""I love you,"" and you say the same words, too?I know that you love me, or you wouldn't have married me. Marrying me was just among the many wonderful things you have done to show me that you are sincere and how much I mean to you. I love you more than life itself--more than my world. You are my world. Life wouldn't be life if I didn't share it with you. We may be far away from each other right now, but my heart and my love can reach across any distance, and I feel your love reaching me here, too. It just feels so wonderful knowing and believing that. Aren't we lucky? I love you--more and more each day.",1

They say love can't be seen; it can only be felt. But they were wrong. I have seen it many times. I have seen true love for me in your eyes. And it's the most beautiful thing I have ever seen!,1
"Words can become a burden, when it is you that I am trying to express my love to. You see, it is a very deep, heart-felt love! One that only the right words can do justice to.You lighten my day regardless of what the day may be. If it is raining, the very thought of you turns the raindrops into drops of love that saturates my very soul with the assurance that I will never have to be without your love again.Am I dreaming? Is it real? These are the questions that I asked myself when I awaken from the experience of your love for me. Then I realize that it is real. You do love me and I do love you! What joy! That is something that I never had before, and when it is threatened, my body goes through spasms or something. I experience pains like I never thought possible. The fact is, I love you with a heart-felt love that is beyond verbal expression. For you give me joy.When I touch your hands it becomes an experience that can only be compared with the ecstasy of love's climax. Kissing your lips takes me to places that people only experience in fantasies. What is it that you do to me? I'll tell you. You give me love, the kind of love that can't be bought or haphazardly found. It is the kind of love that can only just happen once in a lifetime with someone as unique as you are.So, while I know that it would be beneath what I really and truly feel in my heart for you, just let me express my heart-felt love for you by merely saying, I love you.",1

"Fräulein Felice! I am now going to ask you a favor which sounds quite crazy, and which I should regard as such, were I the one to receive the letter. It is also the very greatest test that even the kindest person could be put to. Well, this is it: Write to me only once a week, so that your letter arrives on Sunday — for I cannot endure your daily letters, I am incapable of enduring them. For instance, I answer one of your letters, then lie in bed in apparent calm, but my heart beats through my entire body and is conscious only of you. I belong to you; there is really no other way of expressing it, and that is not strong enough. But for this very reason I don’t want to know what you are wearing; it confuses me so much that I cannot deal with life; and that’s why I don’t want to know that you are fond of me. If I did, how could I, fool that I am, go on sitting in my office, or here at home, instead of leaping onto a train with my eyes shut and opening them only when I am with you? Oh, there is a sad, sad reason for not doing so. To make it short: My health is only just good enough for myself alone, not good enough for marriage, let alone fatherhood. Yet when I read your letter, I feel I could overlook even what cannot possibly be overlooked. If only I had your answer now! And how horribly I torment you, and how I compel you, in the stillness of your room, to read this letter, as nasty a letter as has ever lain on your desk! Honestly, it strikes me sometimes that I prey like a spectre on your felicitous name! If only I had mailed Saturday’s letter, in which I implored you never to write to me again, and in which I gave a similar promise. Oh God, what prevented me from sending that letter? All would be well. But is a peaceful solution possible now? Would it help if we wrote to each other only once a week? No, if my suffering could be cured by such means it would not be serious. And already I foresee that I shan’t be able to endure even the Sunday letters. And so, to compensate for Saturday’s lost opportunity, I ask you with what nergy remains to me at the end of this letter: If we value our lives, let us abandon it all. Did I think of signing myself Dein? No, nothing could be more false. No, I am forever fettered to myself, that’s what I am, and that’s what I must try to live with.",1

At that time I was informed that you wanted applicants to have two years work experience in a related field before applying for positions in marketing. For the past two years I have worked as an analyst for Doe Incorporated, gaining valuable experience in market analysis, and now I would like to pursue a position with your firm. I feel I am much better qualified now to meet your needs than I was when I graduated. I have enclosed my resume for your review. I can be reached at 555-5555 to arrange for an interview. I hope to hear from you soon. ",0

"I want to go on record as endorsing John Doe for the office of County Clerk. John has worked effectively in the County Clerk's office for five years, during which time the county population has almost doubled. He brings excellent credentials to this position, with an MA degree from Springfield University in information management and four years experience in the law office of Johnson and Johnson. Since joining the County Clerk's office, he has worked under Jane Doe's direction and has been acting clerk since her untimely death earlier this year.The clerk's duties require filing accurate court records, overseeing the court clerk's duties, organizing voter registration, and scheduling elections. John understands the importance of keeping good records and of dealing congenially with the public. He is honest, reliable, and willing to work the long hours needed for the position. I believe John Doe is the person best qualified to be our next County Clerk. ",0
I feel fortunate to have you in my life as you light it up with your glow. I value your presence more than anything else; I love you.,1
"I am writing to you in response to your Internet advertisement requesting applicants for the position of Technical Writer in Springfield University's archaeology laboratory. I hold bachelor's degrees in archaeology and English and have three seasons' experience in excavation and lab work, including data entry, artifact cataloging, and preparations for the various methods of artifact dating. In addition, I wrote the chapter detailing survey methods for Dr. John Doe's ""Final Report on the Centerville Field School Project."" This work involved transcribing the field notes onto Laboratory of Anthropology forms, mapping and recording sites by section, township, and province, as well as creating a narrative description of the project's survey methods.The years spent in the English department have prepared me for the challenges of writing for a variety of readers, and much of my creative writing has been published. Also, under the guidance of Dr. Doe I have directed my efforts within archaeology toward writing. Archaeology needs writers to make it interesting, especially in this time of budget cuts and battles over land use.I believe I would qualify as ""proficient"" in the use of most of the popular spreadsheet programs and other relevant computer applications. I have spent several months entering data and crunching numbers in the service of archaeology.Please see the attached resume for further details of my qualifications. I will gladly provide references at your request. I can be reached at 555-5555. I look forward to meeting you in person and discussing my suitability for this position. ",0

Any of the local automotive suppliers will gladly vouch for our good credit, and we will be happy to complete an application to expedite the process. Please respond as quickly as possible, so that we may begin taking in machine work again soon. ",0

"I just wanted you to know how much I deeply, truly love you. We've been together for almost three years now, and nothing could change the way I feel about you--or about us as a couple. You are my one and only. I don't think there could ever be enough words in this world to express how I truly feel about you. I love you so much; I just don't know how I could ever explain that differently. But I do know that the one person I can count on always is you. I hope you know this and if you don't, hopefully you'll know it now and forever. I love you with all my heart.",1
"I write this because I want it documented that I am truly in love with you. In case you are not certain of my true feelings, here is my statement of fact: You mean the world to me.

You are the most important thing in the world to me, and I would do anything for you. You make my life complete and I am only happy when we are together.I know that we can't be near each other at the moment, but if we just put up with being apart for a bit longer, it will all work out, and it'll be worth it in the end.

It shows me that you are genuinely supportive of my goals that are such a part of who I am.Thank you for answering all my questions without criticism or impatience.

You have created calmness and safety in my life, which I only ever imagined before.Thank you for the times you've asked me, ""Do you and I need to accept that idea?"" The partnership I had hoped for is expressed in little comments like that.Thank you for speaking so complimentary of me to others. When you do this, you place such value on me that it makes me want to act even better. You helped me to find motivation to go forward again.Thank you for being so appreciative when I remind you of a call to make or an errand to run. It shows me you do not have everything too tightly organized and it makes me want to be the same as you.Thank you for taking the time and having the consideration to inform me when you do have plans. You show you have respect for me and for us. You always protect me from unkind words or behavior, too.Thank you for constantly telling me or showing me that you are attracted to me physically, emotionally, and mentally. You have brought back the confidence I had misplaced some time ago. Thank you for inviting parts of my world into yours and making them one.Thank you for going to the doctor's with me. You show your concern for me and commitment to us and that our relationship is much more than surface deep. Thank you for always being satisfied with our world.

You remind me to have faith and strength in myself, too.Thank you for hugging me and kissing me when I get home as if we were still dating. The passion that I have for you just keeps building!Thank you for playing games with me and talking silly with me. I can see that we will never really grow old together.Thank you for sharing your real estate secrets when you come home from work, then tucking me in at night. Thank you for your love when we hug good night. Thank you for bringing me to a place where pleasure and happiness is truly what makes me feel good.Each day, I am in awe and say to myself, ""I can't believe I just keep falling more and more in love with him every day!"" Each day, I love listening to you more and more. Each day, the intensity and passion of making love to you just gets deeper. Each day, I find myself wanting you more and more. Each day, I find myself more driven, more compassionate, and more appreciative, with greater faith in you and more strength in myself. Each day with you in my life and what you give to me, I see myself becoming a better person! Thank you for all you give to me by just being in my life.I love you and only you, and I want you and only you.

"You are like a dream I never thought would come true for me. When I just hear your voice, I start to smile with joy. My eyes shine with joy if I even believe you are thinking about me. When you sing the song you wrote for me, it makes me feel as if we were meant to be together. You are so special. I pray we will finally know if we are meant to be with one another. I haven't even talked to anyone like you before. You make me feel special like no one has before. The things you do show me that you are such a caring person and will love me till the end of time. I just want to be loved and have someone love me in return, the way I've always wanted. I want to find my best friend, my soul mate, my lover, and my Prince Charming. I feel as if you may just be the one I am looking for and have been searching for all my life. These are the kind of feelings I have for you now.",1
"When you asked my advice on your decision to take on a partner, I knew you were in a tough spot. My own first partnership became a positive experience, but it took some special care. It is, I think, a good move to take John on as full partner. However you must be meticulous in spelling out the terms of the partnership from the outset. In addition, take care to include John in all decisions, even those you would routinely make alone. This is especially important in the beginning.I have had problems due to mistakes in both of these areas, so I know that the extra care will pay off. Of course you've worked very closely with John, and are probably a better judge of these things than I. I have no doubt that you will forge a successful partnership, should you choose to do it. ",0
"Do you remember when we first met? I do. So long ago, but it is still like yesterday to me. Well, I'm more in love with you now than ever. I love it when you come home on late nights and tuck me in, caress my forehead and tell me you love me while I'm still awake. The way you leave me little presents and love notes in my jacket pocket. This is what love is. Taking time to read the love poems I send to you and not laughing at them. You care about me. Thank you for still doing all these things after all these years. I love you. The most important thing isn't the gifts, the notes, or the candy. It's the fact that you spend time thinking about me and that's the real gift. Thank you for being you, my darling--c'est l'amour.",1
"It has been about a year and a half since seeing, hearing, and feeling you next to me. I hope you know that you are still all that is important in my life. Though you made the decision to stop acknowledging my existence in your life, I can never escape the pain and sorrow of the void you have left in my heart and soul. With each passing day, every time I remember to breathe, I die a little more.On the day you asked me to let you go, you didn't know I had planned a new beginning for us. I had planned it all out perfectly--buying the ring that I could afford at the time--and finishing what I should have done a long time ago by finalizing the steps I needed to start our new future. I had gone to court the previous day and turned in all the paper work necessary to begin our new life together. But you asked me to let you go instead.As time went by, I started getting used to living alone, but I never gave up hope that you would come back, yet all this time has passed, and I have come to the reality that I would never see you again. The ring I bought, the life I planned, and the happiness I had dreamed of are all imaginary images now that will continue to torture me as time goes by. If only you knew who I really was, how much I loved you, and the proposal I had planned to make to you that very day.",1

"I am writing as a private citizen and outdoors person to urge you to vote for the Doe Bill coming before Congress this fall. This bill will increase the scant enforcement of laws regulating timber sales on public land in the upland areas of our state. In addition, it makes the timber companies more accountable to the people for the damaging methods of harvest they employ in sensitive areas. I have seen illegal clear-cuts, and I have seen slash burns destroy thousands of acres of wilderness, with no restitution made to the ultimate losers, the public. Big Timber may have the money now to fight this legislation, but with the support of forward-thinking public servants like you, we can work toward balanced, long-term solutions to our land use issues.

"To Peter To her only one after Christ, she who is his alone in Christ. …We were greatly surprised when instead of bringing us the healing balm of comfort you increased our desolation and made the tears to flow which you should have dried. For which of us could remain dry-eyed on hearing the words you wrote towards the end of your letter: ‘But if the Lord shall deliver me into the hands of my enemies so that they overcome and kill me…’? My dearest, how could you think such a thought? How could you give voice to it? Never may God be so forgetful of his humble handmaids as to let them outlive you; never may he grant us a life which would be harder to bear than any form of death. The proper course would be for you to perform our funeral rites, for you to commend our souls to God, and to send ahead of you those whom you assembled for God’s service — so that you need no longer be troubled by worries for us, and follow after us the more gladly because freed from concern for our salvation. Spare us, I implore you, master, spare us words such as these which can only intensify our existing unhappiness; do not deny us, before death, the one thing by which we live. ‘Each day has trouble enough of its own,’ and the day, shrouded in bitterness, will bring with it distress enough to all it comes upon. ‘Why is it necessary,’ says Seneca, ‘to summon evil’ and to destroy life before death comes? You ask us, my love, if you chance to die when absent from us, to have your body brought to our burial-ground so that you may reap a fuller harvest from the prayers we shall offer in constant memory of you. But how could you suppose that our memory of you could ever fade? Besides, what time will there be then which will be fitting for prayer, when extreme distress will allow us no peace, when the soul will lose its power of reason and the tongue its use of speech? Or when the frantic mind, far from being resigned, may even (if I may so) rage against God himself, and provoke him with complaints instead of placating him with prayers? In our misery then we shall have time only for tears and no power to pray; we shall be hurrying to follow, not to bury you, so that we may share your grave instead of laying you in it. If we lose our life in you, we shall not be able to go on living when you leave us. I would not even have us live to see that day, for if the mere mention of your death is death for us, what will the reality be if it finds us still alive? God grant we may never live on to perform this duty, to render you the service which we look for from you alone; in this may we go before, not after you!",1
My love for you is always growing stronger and I'm slowly losing myself deeper into it.,1

I could tell you were waiting for me just because of the way you looked in my eyes. I could see your soul then, knowing that we would spend the rest of our lives together.

"Every morning, I wake up realizing what I did, and nothing in the world can make it go away. I'm sorry for leaving the second time, and I regret that decision. When we met each other at the Liberty Diner and I saw your face, your eyes glistened with the same sparkle that mine had when I first saw you. I felt driven. That feeling has never left and will never leave.I remember waking up to next to you, watching you as you slept, watching the way you walked to your car, the way you answered the phone, the way your lips curled when you said ""I love you,"" the way you blew in my face when I took your breath away and, most importantly, the way you showed me how to love you. Those are the few things I miss, and I would give anything in the world to have all that back again. But my mistake cost me happiness and the love I'll never find again. It hurts me day in and day out to think about it. And what hurts the worst is knowing that I hurt someone who was in love with me.I am still so much in love with you. My leaving left me with a lot of pain, the kind of pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone. I'm not good at writing letters, as you know, but this is how I feel.I love you so much.

You have shown me countless times how much you care and how much you believe in me. You have given me the strength to give up something that has had a hold on my life for a very long time.
