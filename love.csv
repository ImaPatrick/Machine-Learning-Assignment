"My Dearest Friend, should I draw you the picture of my heart it would be what I hope you would still love though it contained nothing new.  The early possession you obtained there, and the absolute power you have obtained over it, leaves not the smallest space unoccupied.I look back to the early days of our acquaintance and friendship as to the days of love and innocence, and, with an indescribable pleasure, I have seen near a score of years roll over our heads with an affection heightened and improved by time, nor have the dreary years of absence in the smallest degree effaced from my mind the image of the dear untitled man to whom I gave my heart.",1

"Our love will bloom always fairer, fresher, more gracious, because it is a true love, and because genuine love is ever increasing. It is a beautiful plant growing from year to year in the heart, ever extending its palms and branches, doubling every season its glorious clusters and perfumes; and, my dear life, tell me, repeat to me always, that nothing will bruise its bark or its delicate leaves, that it will grow larger in both our hearts, loved, free, watched over, like a life within our life…",1

And that night was wonderfullest of all. The light and the shadow and quietness and the rain and the wood. And you.

"Fräulein Felice! I am now going to ask you a favor which sounds quite crazy, and which I should regard as such, were I the one to receive the letter. It is also the very greatest test that even the kindest person could be put to. Well, this is it: Write to me only once a week, so that your letter arrives on Sunday — for I cannot endure your daily letters, I am incapable of enduring them. For instance, I answer one of your letters, then lie in bed in apparent calm, but my heart beats through my entire body and is conscious only of you. I belong to you; there is really no other way of expressing it, and that is not strong enough. But for this very reason I don’t want to know what you are wearing; it confuses me so much that I cannot deal with life; and that’s why I don’t want to know that you are fond of me. If I did, how could I, fool that I am, go on sitting in my office, or here at home, instead of leaping onto a train with my eyes shut and opening them only when I am with you? Oh, there is a sad, sad reason for not doing so. To make it short: My health is only just good enough for myself alone, not good enough for marriage, let alone fatherhood. Yet when I read your letter, I feel I could overlook even what cannot possibly be overlooked. If only I had your answer now! And how horribly I torment you, and how I compel you, in the stillness of your room, to read this letter, as nasty a letter as has ever lain on your desk! Honestly, it strikes me sometimes that I prey like a spectre on your felicitous name! If only I had mailed Saturday’s letter, in which I implored you never to write to me again, and in which I gave a similar promise. Oh God, what prevented me from sending that letter? All would be well. But is a peaceful solution possible now? Would it help if we wrote to each other only once a week? No, if my suffering could be cured by such means it would not be serious. And already I foresee that I shan’t be able to endure even the Sunday letters. And so, to compensate for Saturday’s lost opportunity, I ask you with what nergy remains to me at the end of this letter: If we value our lives, let us abandon it all. Did I think of signing myself Dein? No, nothing could be more false. No, I am forever fettered to myself, that’s what I am, and that’s what I must try to live with.",1

"My very dear Sarah: The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days — perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write you again, I feel impelled to write lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more. Our movement may be one of a few days duration and full of pleasure — and it may be one of severe conflict and death to me. Not my will, but thine 0 God, be done. If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for my country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in, the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans upon the triumph of the Government, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution. And I am willing — perfectly willing — to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt. But, my dear wife, when I know that with my own joys I lay down nearly all of yours, and replace them in this life with cares and sorrows — when, after having eaten for long years the bitter fruit of orphanage myself, I must offer it as their only sustenance to my dear little children — is it weak or dishonorable, while the banner of my purpose floats calmly and proudly in the breeze, that my unbounded love for you, my darling wife and children, should struggle in fierce, though useless, contest with my love of country? I cannot describe to you my feelings on this calm summer night, when two thousand men are sleeping around me, many of them enjoying the last, perhaps, before that of death — and I, suspicious that Death is creeping behind me with his fatal dart, am communing with God, my country, and thee. I have sought most closely and diligently, and often in my breast, for a wrong motive in thus hazarding the happiness of those I loved and I could not find one. A pure love of my country and of the principles have often advocated before the people and “the name of honor that I love more than I fear death” have called upon me, and I have obeyed. Sarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield. The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when God willing, we might still have lived and loved together and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me — perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar — that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name. Forgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have oftentimes been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness, and struggle with all the misfortune of this world, to shield you and my children from harm. But I cannot. I must watch you from the spirit land and hover near you, while you buffet the storms with your precious little freight, and wait with sad patience till we meet to part no more. But, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the garish day and in the darkest night — amidst your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours — always, always; and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath; or the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by. Sarah, do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again. As for my little boys, they will grow as I have done, and never know a father’s love and care. Little Willie is too young to remember me long, and my blue-eyed Edgar will keep my frolics with him among the dimmest memories of his childhood. Sarah, I have unlimited confidence in your maternal care and your development of their characters. Tell my two mothers his and hers I call God’s blessing upon them. O Sarah, I wait for you there! Come to me, and lead thither my children. Sullivan",1
"im not afraid to admit that I was a fan of slice. i said as soon as Shamrock weighed in at 206.5 that a lighter fighter would be the most dangerous scenario for an inexperienced gorilla like Kimbo. I never had any illusions about him. I thought that at best, he'd have a 10-4 or 12-6 record at 38. Slice has never even had an amateur career and he's going up against guys who've been doing it their entire lives. he was SUPPOSED to be fighting tomato cans. everybody demanded that he fight stiffer competition to justify the personna that Elite XC manufactured or magnified for him. i wasn't a supporter because I bought into that hype. the fight world and entertainment in general has always been plagued by that kind of hypocrisy. good fiction outsells reality in every genre.",0

"My dearest Teresa, I have read this book in your garden;–my love, you were absent, or else I could not have read it. It is a favourite book of yours, and the writer was a friend of mine. You will not understand these English words, and others will not understand them,–which is the reason I have not scrawled them in Italian. But you will recognize the handwriting of him who passionately loved you, and you will divine that, over a book which was yours, he could only think of love. In that word, beautiful in all languages, but most so in yours–Amor mio–is comprised my existence here and hereafter. I feel I exist here, and I feel I shall exist hereafter,–to what purpose you will decide; my destiny rests with you, and you are a woman, eighteen years of age, and two out of a convent. I love you, and you love me,–at least, you say so, and act as if you did so, which last is a great consolation in all events. But I more than love you, and cannot cease to love you. Think of me, sometimes, when the Alps and ocean divide us, –but they never will, unless you wish it.",1

Where would be your 54 years? and my grandmother’s heart? and how many hours would you be late for dinner? — If you give me one kiss and you can only kiss me if I say ‘kiss me’ and I will never say ‘kiss me’ because I am a respectable widow and I wouldn’t let any man kiss me unless I was sure of the wedding ring — Stella.",1
"To Elizabeth Barrett Browning: …would I, if I could, supplant one of any of the affections that I know to have taken root in you – that great and solemn one, for instance. I feel that if I could get myself remade, as if turned to gold, I WOULD not even then desire to become more than the mere setting to that diamond you must always wear. The regard and esteem you now give me, in this letter, and which I press to my heart and bow my head upon, is all I can take and all too embarrassing, using all my gratitude. – Robert Browning",1

"Yes, Marquis, I will keep my word with you, and upon all occasions shall speak the truth, though I sometimes tell it at my own expense. I have more firmness of mind than perhaps you may imagine, and ’tis very probable that in the course of this correspondence, you will think I push this quality too far, even to severity. But then, please to remember that I have only the outside of a woman, and that my heart and mind are wholly masculine…. Shall I tell you what makes love so dangerous? ‘Tis the too high idea we are apt to form it. But to speak the truth, love, considered as passion, is merely a blind instinct, that we should rate accordingly. It is an appetite, which inclines us to one object, rather than another, without our being able to account for our taste. Considered as a bond of friendship, where reason presides, it is no longer a passion and loses the very name of love. It becomes esteem: which is indeed a very pleasing appetite, but too tranquil; and therefore incapable of rousing you from you present supineness. If you madly trace the footsteps of our ancient heroes of romance, adopting their extravagant sentiments, you will soon experience, that such false chivalry metamorphoses this charming passion into a melancholy folly; nay, often a tragical one: a perfect frenzy! but divest it of all the borrowed pomp and opinion, and you will then perceive how much it will contribute both to your happiness and pleasure. Be assured that if either reason or knight errantry should be permitted to form the union of our hearts, love would become a state of apathy and madness. The only way to avoid these extremes, is to pursue the course I pointed out to you. At present you have no occasion for any thing more than mere amusement, and believe me, you will not meet it except among women of the character I speak of. Your heart wants occupation; and they are framed to supply the void. At least, give my prescription a fair trial, and I will be answerable for the success. I promised to reason with you, and I think I have kept my word. Farewell...",1

"My beloved angel, I am nearly mad about you, as much as one can be mad: I cannot bring together two ideas that you do not interpose yourself between them.

As for my heart, there you will always be – very much so.  I have a delicious sense of you there.  But my God, what is to become of me, if you have deprived me of my reason?  This is a monomania which, this morning, terrifies me. I rise up every moment saying to myself, “Come, I am going there!” Then I sit down again, moved by the sense of my obligations.  There is a frightful conflict.  This is not life.  I have never before been like that.  You have devoured everything. I feel foolish and happy as soon as I think of you.  I whirl round in a delicious dream in which in one instant I live a thousand years. What a horrible situation! Overcome with love, feeling love in every pore, living only for love, and seeing oneself consumed by griefs, and caught in a thousand spiders’ threads. O, my darling Eva, you did not know it.  I picked up your card.  It is there before me, and I talk to you as if you were there.  I see you, as I did yesterday, beautiful, astonishingly beautiful. Yesterday, during the whole evening, I said to myself “she is mine!” Ah!  The angels are not as happy in Paradise as I was yesterday!",1

I will not tell you to what degree you are dazzling and to the birds of sweet song who, as you know, are none the less beautiful and appreciative. I am content to delegate to them the duty of watching, listening and admiring, while to myself I reserve the right of loving; this may be less attractive to the ear, but it is sweeter far to the heart.

You have the greatest soul, the noblest nature, the sweetest, most loving heart I have ever known, and my love, my reverence, my admiration for you, you have increased in one evening as I should have thought only a lifetime of intimate, loving association could have increased them.

"My dear Friend, Yes, I have told you, and repeat it: I love you dearly. You certainly said the same thing to me, I begin to know the world. I will tell you what I suggest, now: pay attention. I don’t want to remain a shopgirl, but a little more my own mistress, and would therefore like to find someone to keep me. If I did not love you, I would try to get money from you; I would say to you, you shall begin by renting me a room and furnishing it; only as you told me that you are not rich, you can take me to your own place. It will not cost you anymore rent, nor more for your table and the rest of your housekeeping. To keep me and my headdress will be the only expense, and for those give me one hundred livres a month, and that will include everything. Thus we could both live happily, and you would never again have to complain about my refusal. If you love me, accept this proposal; but if you do not love me, then let each of us try his luck elsewhere. Good-by, I embrace you heartily, Jeanne Rancon",1

Have you forgotten me?  I am the man you used to say you loved.  I used to sleep in your arms – do you remember?  But you never write. You are perhaps mindless of me.  I am not of you.  I love you. There isn’t a moment of any hideous day when I do not say to myself. ‘It will be alright.  I shall go home.  Caitlin loves me.  I love Caitlin.’  But perhaps you have forgotten.  If you have forgotten, or lost your affection for me, please, my Cat, let me know.  I Love You.

" You fear, sometimes, I do not love you so much as you wish? My dear Girl I love you ever and ever and without reserve. The more I have known you the more have I lov’d. In every way – even my jealousies have been agonies of Love, in the hottest fit I ever had I would have died for you. I have vex’d you too much. But for Love! Can I help it? You are always new. The last of your kisses was ever the sweetest; the last smile the brightest; the last movement the gracefullest. When you pass’d my window home yesterday, I was fill’d with as much admiration as if I had then seen you for the first time. You uttered a half complaint once that I only lov’d your Beauty. Have I nothing else then to love in you but that? Do not I see a heart naturally furnish’d with wings imprison itself with me? No ill prospect has been able to turn your thoughts a moment from me. This perhaps should be as much a subject of sorrow as joy – but I will not talk of that. Even if you did not love me I could not help an entire devotion to you: how much more deeply then must I feel for you knowing you love me. My Mind has been the most discontented and restless one that ever was put into a body too small for it. I never felt my Mind repose upon anything with complete and undistracted enjoyment – upon no person but you. When you are in the room my thoughts never fly out of window: you always concentrate my whole senses. The anxiety shown about our Love in your last note is an immense pleasure to me; however you must not suffer such speculations to molest you any more: not will I any more believe you can have the least pique against me.

"Do you know, when you have told me to think of you, I have been feeling ashamed of thinking of you so much, of thinking of only you–which is too much, perhaps. Shall I tell you? It seems to me, to myself, that no man was ever before to any woman what you are to me–the fulness must be in proportion, you know, to the vacancy…and only I know what was behind–the long wilderness without the blossoming rose…and the capacity for happiness, like a black gaping hole, before this silver flooding. Is it wonderful that I should stand as in a dream, and disbelieve–not you–but my own fate? Was ever any one taken suddenly from a lampless dungeon and placed upon the pinnacle of a mountain, without the head turning round and the heart turning faint, as mine do? And you love me more, you say?–Shall I thank you or God? Both,–indeed–and there is no possible return from me to either of you! I thank you as the unworthy may.. and as we all thank God. How shall I ever prove what my heart is to you? How will you ever see it as I feel it? I ask myself in vain.

When I go to bed, I do not fail to make room for you; I push myself quite close to the wall and leave a great empty space in my small bed. This movement is mechanical, these thoughts are involuntary. Ah! how one accustoms oneself to happiness. Alas! one only knows it well when one has lost it, and I’m sure we have only learnt to appreciate how necessary we are to each other, since the thunderbolt has parted us. The source of our tears has not dried up, dear Sophie; we cannot become healed; we have enough in our hearts to love always, and, because of that, enough to weep always. Gabriel",1
"Ya ok, then had dinner?",0
"I would have liked to have dined with you today, after finishing your essay – that my eyes, and lips, I do not exactly mean my voice, might have told you that they had raised you in my esteem.  What a cold word!  I would say love, if you will promise not to dispute about its propriety, when I want to express an increasing affection, founded on a more intimate acquaintance with your heart and understanding. I shall cork up all my kindness – yet the fine volatile essence may fly off in my walk – you know not how much tenderness for you may escape in a voluptuous sigh, should the air, as is often the case, give a pleasurable movement to the sensations, that have been clustering round my heart, as I read this morning – reminding myself, every now and then, that the writer loved me. Voluptuous is often expressive of a meaning I do not now intend to give, I would describe one of those moments, when the senses are exactly tuned by the ringing tenderness of the heart and according reason entices you to live in the present moment, regardless of the past or future – it is not rapture – it is sublime tranquility. I have felt it in your arms – hush!  Let not the light see, I was going to say hear it – these confessions should only be uttered – you know where, when the curtains are up – and all the world shut out – Ah me! I wish I may find you at home when I carry this letter to drop it in the box, – that I may drop a kiss with it into your heart, to be embalmed, till me meet, closer.",1
"Nothing could have given me greater pleasure that to get news of you. The prospect of remaining two months without hearing about you had been extremely disagreeable to me: that is to say, your little note was more than welcome. I hope you are laying up a stock of good air and that you will come back to us in October. As for me, I think I shall not go anywhere; I shall stay in the country, where I spend the whole day in front of my open window or in the garden. We have promised each other — haven’t we? — to be at least great friends. If you will only not change your mind! For there are no promises that are binding; such things cannot be ordered at will. It would be a fine thing, just the same, in which I hardly dare believe, to pass our lives near each other, hypnotized by our dreams: your patriotic dream, our humanitarian dream, and our scientific dream. Of all those dreams the last is, I believe, the only legitimate one. I mean by that that we are powerless to change the social order and, even if we were not, we should not know what to do; in taking action, no matter in what direction, we should never be sure of not doing more harm than good, by retarding some inevitable evolution. From the scientific point of view, on the contrary, we may hope to do something; the ground is solider here, and any discovery that we may make, however small, will remain acquired knowledge. See how it works out: it is agreed that we shall be great friends, but if you leave France in a year it would be an altogether too Platonic friendship, that of two creatures who would never see each other again. Wouldn’t it be better for you to stay with me? I know that this question angers you, and that you don’t want to speak of it again — and then, too, I feel so thoroughly unworthy of you from every point of view. I thought of asking your permission to meet you by chance in Fribourg. But you are staying there, unless I am mistaken, only one day, and on that day you will of course belong to our friends the Kovalskis. Believe me your very devoted Peirre Curie",1

"I know that when two wayfarers ‘take shelter under the same tree and slake their thirst in the same river’ it has all been determined by their karma from a previous life. For the past few years you and I have shared the same pillow as man and wife who had intended to live and grow old together, and I have become as attached to you as your own shadow. This is what I believed, and I think this is what you have also thought about us. But now I have learnt about the final enterprise on which you have decided and, though I cannot be with you to share the grand moment, I rejoice in the knowledge of it. It is said that (on the eve of his final battle) the Chinese general, Hsiang Yü, valiant warrior though he was, grieved deeply about leaving Lady Yü, and that (in our own country) Kiso Yoshinaka lamented his parting from Lady Matsudono. I have now abandoned all hope about our future together in this world, and (mindful of their example) I have resolved to take the ultimate step while you are still alive. I shall be waiting for you at the end of what they call the road to death. I pray that you may never, never forget the great bounty, deep as the ocean, high as the mountains, that has been bestowed upon us for so many years by our lord, Prince Hideyori.",1

If we were together, you’d feel how strong it is — you’re so sweet when you’re melancholy. I love your sad tenderness — when I’ve hurt you — That’s one of the reasons I could never be sorry for our quarrels — and they bothered you so — Those dear, dear little fusses, when I always tried so hard to make you kiss and forget — Scott — there’s nothing in all the world I want but you — and your precious love — All the material things are nothing. I’d just hate to live a sordid, colorless existence — because you’d soon love me less — and less — and I’d do anything — anything — to keep your heart for my own — I don’t want to live — I want to love first, and live incidentally — Why don’t you feel that I’m waiting — I’ll come to you, Lover, when you’re ready — Don’t don’t ever think of the things you can’t give me — You’ve trusted me with the dearest heart of all — and it’s so damn much more than anybody else in all the world has ever had — How can you think deliberately of life without me — If you should die — O Darling — darling Scott — It’d be like going blind. I know I would, too, — I’d have no purpose in life — just a pretty — decoration. Don’t you think I was made for you? I feel like you had me ordered — and I was delivered to you — to be worn — I want you to wear me, like a watch — charm or a button hole boquet — to the world. And then, when we’re alone, I want to help — to know that you can’t do anything without me. I’m glad you wrote Mamma. It was such a nice sincere letter — and mine to St. Paul was very evasive and rambling.

I’m tired in the face.” He looked a little grave, and said, “Oh, it’s your nose that’s tired: a person often talks too much when he thinks he knows a great deal.” I said, “No, it isn’t the nose. Perhaps it’s the hair.” Then he looked rather grave, and said, “Now I understand: you’ve been playing too many hairs on the pianoforte.” “No, indeed I haven’t!” I said, “and it isn’t exactly the hair: it’s more about the nose and chin.” Then he looked a good deal graver, and said, “Have you been walking much on your chin lately?” I said, “No.” “Well!” he said, “it puzzles me very much. Do you think it’s in the lips?” “Of course!” I said. “That’s exactly what it is!” Then he looked very grave indeed, and said, “I think you must have been giving too many kisses.” “Well,” I said, “I did give one kiss to a baby child, a little friend of mine.” “Think again,” he said; “are you sure it was only one?” I thought again, and said, “Perhaps it was eleven times.” Then the doctor said, “You must not give her any more till your lips are quite rested again.” “But what am I to do?” I said, “because you see, I owe her a hundred and eighty-two more.” Then he looked so grave that tears ran down his cheeks, and he said, “You may send them to her in a box.” Then I remembered a little box that I once bought at Dover, and thought I would someday give it to some little girl or other. So I have packed them all in it very carefully. Tell me if they come safe or if any are lost on the way.” — If you give me one kiss and you can only kiss me if I say ‘kiss me’ and I will never say ‘kiss me’ because I am a respectable widow and I wouldn’t let any man kiss me unless I was sure of the wedding ring — Stella.",1

Truly can I say that for the seven years since I avowed my love for you, I have…foregone all company, and the society of all females (except my own relations) for your sake. I am still ready to make my sacrifice for you…I will submit to any thing you may command me–but cease to respect, to love and adore you I never can or will. I must still think that we should have married long ago–we should have had many troubles–but we have yet had no joys, and we could not have starved…Your FRIENDS have never been without a hope of parting us and see what that has cost us both–but no more. Believe me, my beloved & ever dearest Maria, most faithfully yours, John",1

"Best Beloved, I send you some allumettes (lampshades) wherewith to kindle the taper. There are very few but my second finger could no longer perform extra duty. These will serve till the wounded one be healed, however. How beautiful is it to provide even this slightest convenience for you, dearest! I cannot tell you how much I love you, in this back-handed style. My love is not in this attitude,– it rather bends forward to meet you. What a year has been to us! My definition of Beauty is, that it is love, and therefore includes both truth and good. But those only who love as we do can feel the significance and force of this. My ideas will not flow in these crooked strokes. God be with you. I am very well, and have walked far in Danvers this cold morning. I am full of the glory of the day. God bless you this night of the old year. It has proved the year of our nativity. Ha not the old earth passed away from us?–are not all things new? Your Sophie",1

You are my very life Sweetheart, and every separation gives such endless heartache… Goodbye my Angel, Husband of my heart I envy my flowers that will accompany you.  I press you tightly to my breast, kiss every sweet place with tender love… God bless and protect you, guard you from all harm, guide you safely and firmly into the new year.  May it bring glory and sure peace, and the reward for all this war has cost you.

For my part I do pardon you all, yea, I do wish and devoutly pray God that He will also pardon you. For the rest I commend unto you Mary, our daughter, beseeching you to be a good father unto her, as I heretofore desired. I entreat you also, on behalf of my maids, to give them marriage-portions, which is not much, they being but three. For all my other servants, I solicit a year’s pay more than their due, lest they should be unprovided for. Lastly, do I vow, that mine eyes desire you above all things.",1

"After the two delightful evenings spent yesterday and the day before, I shall certainly not go out tonight, but will sit here at home and write to you. Besides, my Adele, my adorable and adored Adele, what have I not to tell you? O, God! for two days, I have been asking myself every moment if such happiness is not a dream. It seems to me that what I feel is not of earth. I cannot yet comprehend this cloudless heaven. You do not yet know, Adele, to what I had resigned myself. Alas, do I know it myself? Because I was weak, I fancied I was calm; because I was preparing myself for all the mad follies of despair, I thought I was courageous and resigned. Ah! let me cast myself humbly at your feet, you who are so grand, so tender and strong! I had been thinking that the utmost limit of my devotion could only be the sacrifice of my life; but you, my generous love, were ready to sacrifice for me the repose of yours. …You have been privileged to receive every gift from nature, you have both fortitude and tears. Oh, Adele, do not mistake these words for blind enthusiasm – enthusiasm for you has lasted all my life, and increased day by day. My whole soul is yours. If my entire existence had not been yours, the harmony of my being would have been lost, and I must have died — died inevitably. These were my meditations, Adele, when the letter that was to bring me hope of else despair arrived. If you love me, you know what must have been my joy. What I know you may have felt, I will not describe. My Adele, why is there no word for this but joy? Is it because there is no power in human speech to express such happiness? The sudden bound from mournful resignation to infinite felicity seemed to upset me. Even now I am still beside myself and sometimes I tremble lest I should suddenly awaken from this dream divine. Oh, now you are mine! At last you are mine! Soon — in a few months, perhaps, my angel will sleep in my arms, will awaken in my arms, will live there. All your thoughts at all moments, all your looks will be for me; all my thoughts, all my moments, all my looks, will be for you! My Adele! Adieu, my angel, my beloved Adele! Adieu! I will kiss your hair and go to bed. Still I am far from you, but I can dream of you. Soon perhaps you will be at my side. Adieu; pardon the delirium of your husband who embraces you, and who adores you, both for this life and another.",1
"My darling, Do not imagine, because you find these lines in your journal that I have been trespassing.  You know I have not – and where else shall  I leave a love letter?  For I long to write you a love-letter tonight. You are all about me – I seem to breathe you, hear you, feel you in me and of me. What am I doing here?  You are away.  I have seen you in the train, at the station, driving up, sitting in the lamplight, talking,  greeting people, washing your hands…  And I am here – in your tent – sitting at your table. There are some wall-flower petals on the table and a dead match, a blue pencil and a Magdeburgische Zeitung.  I am just as much at  home as they. When dusk came, flowing up the silent garden, lapping against the blind windows, my first and last terror started up.  I was making  some coffee in the kitchen.  It was so violent, so dreadful I put down the coffee pot – and simply ran away – ran ran out of the studio  and up the street with my bag under one arm and a block of writing paper and a pen under the other.  I felt that if I could get here  and find Mrs. F I should be *safe*. I found her and I lighted your gas, wound up your clock, drew your curtains and embraced your black overcoat before I sat down,  frightened no longer.  Do not be angry with me, Bogey.  Ca a ete plus fort que moi ….  That is why I am here. When you came to tea this afternoon you took a brioche, broke it in half and padded the inside doughy bit with two fingers.  You  always do that with a bun or roll or a piece of bread.  It is your way – your head a little on one side the while. When you opened your suitcase, I saw your old Feltie and a French book and a com all higgledy-piggedly.  ‘Tig, Ive only got 3  handkerchiefs.’ Why should that memory be so sweet to me?… Last night, there was a moment before you got into bed.  You stood, quite naked, bending forward a little, talking.  It was only for  an instant.  I saw you – I loved you so, loved your body with such tenderness.  Ah, my dear! And I am not thinking of *passion*.  No, of that other thing that makes me feel that every inch of you is so precious to me – your  soft shoulders – your creamy warm skin, your ears cold like shells are cold – your long legs and your feet that I love to clasp with my  feet – the feeling of your belly – and your thin young back.  Just below that bone that sticks out at the back of your neck you have a  little mole. It is partly because we are young that I feel this tenderness.  I love your mouth.  I could not bear that it should be touched even by  a cold wind if I were the Lord. We two, you know, have everything before us, and we shall do very great things.  I have perfect faith in us, and so perfect is my love  for you that I am, as it were, still, silent to my very soul. I want nobody but you for my lover and my friend and to nobody buy you shall I be faithful. I am yours forever. Tig.",1
One of best dialogue in cute reltnship..!! \Wen i Die,0
"Eight days have passed since I parted from f.f., and already it is as though I had been eight years away from her, although I can avow that not one hour has passed without her memory which has become such a close companion to my thoughts that now more than ever is it the food and sustenance of my soul; and if it should endure like this a few days more, as seems it must, I truly believe it will in every way have assumed the office of my soul, and I shall then live and thrive on the memory of her as do other men upon their souls, and I shall have no life but in this single thought. Let the God who so decrees do as he will, so long as in exchange I may have as much a part of her as shall suffice to prove the gospel of our affinity is founded on true prophecy. Often I find myself recalling, and with what ease, certain words spoken to me, some on the balcony with the moon as witness, others at that window I shall always look upon so gladly, with all the many endearing and gracious acts I have seen my gentle lady perform–for all are dancing about my heart with a tenderness so wondrous that they inflame me with a strong desire to beg her to test the quality of my love. For I shall never rest content until I am certain she knows what she is able to enact in me and how great and strong is the fire that her great worth has kindled in my breast. The flame of true love is a mighty force, and most of all when two equally matched wills in two exalted minds contend to see which loves the most, each striving to give yet more vital proof… It would be the greatest delight for me to see just two lines in f.f.’s hand, yet I dare not ask so much. May your Ladyship beseech her to perform whatever you feel is best for me. With my heart I kiss your Ladyship’s hand, since I cannot with my lips.",1

"My angel, my all, my very self — only a few words today and at that with your pencil — not till tomorrow will my lodgings be definitely determined upon — what a useless waste of time. Why this deep sorrow where necessity speaks — can our love endure except through sacrifices — except through not demanding everything — can you change it that you are not wholly mine, I not wholly thine? Oh, God! look out into the beauties of nature and comfort yourself with that which must be — love demands everything and that very justly — that it is with me so far as you are concerned, and you with me. If we were wholly united you would feel the pain of it as little as I! Now a quick change to things internal from things external. We shall surely see each other; moreover, I cannot communicate to you the observations I have made during the last few days touching my own life — if our hearts were always close together I would make none of the kind. My heart is full of many things to say to you – Ah! — there are moments when I feel that speech is nothing after all — cheer up — remain my true, only treasure, my all as I am yours; the gods must send us the rest that which shall be best for us. Your faithful, Ludwig",1
"I cannot keep myself from writing any longer to you dearest, although I have not had any answer to either of my two letters. I suppose your mother does not allow you to write to me. Perhaps you have not got either of my letters…I am so dreadfully afraid that perhaps you may think I am forgetting you. I can assure you dearest Jeannette you have not been out of my thoughts hardly for one minute since I left you Monday. I have written to my father everything, how much I love you how much I long & pray & how much I wld sacrifice if it were necessary to be married to you and to live ever after with you. I shall [not] get an answer till Monday & whichever way it lies I shall go to Cowes soon after & tell your mother everything. I am afraid she does not like me vy much from what I have heard…I wld do anything she wished if she only wld not oppose us. Dearest if you are as fond of me as I am of you…nothing human cld keep us long apart. This last week has seemed an eternity to me; Oh, I wld give my soul for another of those days we had together not long ago…Oh if I cld only get one line from you to reassure me, but I dare not ask you to do anything that your mother wld disapprove of or has perhaps forbidden you to do… Sometimes I doubt so I cannot help it whether you really like me as you said at Cowes you did. If you do I cannot fear for the future tho’ difficulties may lie in our way only to be surmounted by patience.  Goodbye dearest Jeannette.

Are you worried?… My soul aches with sorrow, and there can be no rest for you lover; but is there still more in store for me when, yielding to the profound feelings which overwhelm me, I draw from your lips, from your heart a love which consumes me with fire? Ah! it was last night that I fully realized how false an image of you your portrait gives! You are leaving at noon; I shall see you in three hours. Until then, mio dolce amor, a thousand kisses; but give me none in return, for they set my blood on fire.",1

Time passes swiftly, but is it not joyous to see how great and growing is the treasure we have gathered together, amid the storms and stresses of so many eventful and to millions tragic and terrible years?

"I didn't say all republicans are racist, what I said rather, was that the republican party has a history of racism. Also, the republican party is in denial about this and this is exactly why most blacks will not vote for a republican. If you read the article, the author suggests that it is a good thing that Bush is reaching out to black voters finally, but it will not work until the republican party adresses it's racism in the past. I've yet to hear a good reason for Reagan to deliver his initial campaign speech, repleat with overtones of states rights vs federal rights, in Philadelphia, MI, the exact town in which three civil rights workers were murdered in one of the 1960s' ugliest cases of racist violence. It was a ringing declaration of his support for ""states' rights"" Ã¢Â€Â” a code word for resistance to black advances clearly understood by white Southern voters.

Oh! you believe me capable of self-sacrifice, chastity, temperance and piety, do you not? But let no more be said of  this… it is for you to question, to draw conclusions, to save me as you see fit.

"To Peter To her only one after Christ, she who is his alone in Christ. …We were greatly surprised when instead of bringing us the healing balm of comfort you increased our desolation and made the tears to flow which you should have dried. For which of us could remain dry-eyed on hearing the words you wrote towards the end of your letter: ‘But if the Lord shall deliver me into the hands of my enemies so that they overcome and kill me…’? My dearest, how could you think such a thought? How could you give voice to it? Never may God be so forgetful of his humble handmaids as to let them outlive you; never may he grant us a life which would be harder to bear than any form of death. The proper course would be for you to perform our funeral rites, for you to commend our souls to God, and to send ahead of you those whom you assembled for God’s service — so that you need no longer be troubled by worries for us, and follow after us the more gladly because freed from concern for our salvation. Spare us, I implore you, master, spare us words such as these which can only intensify our existing unhappiness; do not deny us, before death, the one thing by which we live. ‘Each day has trouble enough of its own,’ and the day, shrouded in bitterness, will bring with it distress enough to all it comes upon. ‘Why is it necessary,’ says Seneca, ‘to summon evil’ and to destroy life before death comes? You ask us, my love, if you chance to die when absent from us, to have your body brought to our burial-ground so that you may reap a fuller harvest from the prayers we shall offer in constant memory of you. But how could you suppose that our memory of you could ever fade? Besides, what time will there be then which will be fitting for prayer, when extreme distress will allow us no peace, when the soul will lose its power of reason and the tongue its use of speech? Or when the frantic mind, far from being resigned, may even (if I may so) rage against God himself, and provoke him with complaints instead of placating him with prayers? In our misery then we shall have time only for tears and no power to pray; we shall be hurrying to follow, not to bury you, so that we may share your grave instead of laying you in it. If we lose our life in you, we shall not be able to go on living when you leave us. I would not even have us live to see that day, for if the mere mention of your death is death for us, what will the reality be if it finds us still alive? God grant we may never live on to perform this duty, to render you the service which we look for from you alone; in this may we go before, not after you!",1

"To Josephine, I love you no longer; on the contrary, I detest you. you are a wretch, truly perverse, truly stupid, a real Cinderella. You never write to me at all, you do not love your husband; you know the pleasure that your letters give him yet you cannot even manage to write him half a dozen lines, dashed off in a moment! What then do you do all day, Madame? What business is so vital that it robs you of the time to write to your faithful lover? What attachment can be stifling and pushing aside the love, the tender and constant love which you promised him? Who can this wonderful new lover be who takes up your every moment, rules your days and prevents you from devoting your attention to your husband? Beware, Josephine; one fine night the doors will be broken down and there I shall be. In truth, I am worried, my love, to have no news from you; write me a four page letter instantly made up from those delightful words which fill my heart with emotion and joy. I hope to hold you in my arms before long, when I shall lavish upon you a million kisses, burning as the equatorial sun.",1
"My Dearest Husband …I was at that date of marriage a very different being from what I am now and stood in relation to my Heavenly Father in a very different attitude. My whole desire was to live in love, absorbing passionate devotion to one person. Our separation was my first trial — but then came a note of comfort in the hope of being a mother. No creature ever so longed to see the face of a little one or had such a heart full of love to bestow. Here came in trial again sickness, pain, perplexity, constant discouragement — wearing wasting days and nights — a cross, deceitful, unprincipled nurse — husband gone… When you came back you came only to increasing perplexities. Ah, how little comfort I had in being a mother — how was all that I proposed met and crossed and my may ever hedged up! …In short, God would teach me that I should make no family be my chief good and portion and bitter as the lesson has been I thank Him for it from my very soul. One might naturally infer that from the union of two both morbidly sensitive and acute, yet in many respects exact opposites — one hasty and impulsive — the other sensitive and brooding — one the very personification of exactness and routine and the other to whom everything of the kind was an irksome effort — from all this what should one infer but some painful friction. But all this would not after all have done so very much had not Providence as if intent to try us throws upon the heaviest external pressure… but still where you have failed your faults have been to me those of one beloved — of the man who after all would be the choice of my heart still were I to choose — for were I now free I should again love just as I did and again feel that I could give up all to and for you — and if I do not love never can love again with the blind and unwise love with which I married I love quite as truly tho far more wisely… In reflecting upon our future union — our marriage — the past obstacles to our happiness — it seems to me that they are of two or three kinds. 1st those from physical causes both in you and in me — such on your part as hypochondriac morbid instability for which the only remedy is physical care and attention to the laws of health — and on my part an excess of sensitiveness and of confusion and want of control of mind and memory. This always increases on my part in proportion as a I blamed and found fault with and I hope will decrease with returning health. I hope that we shall both be impressed with a most solemn sense of the importance of a wise and constant attention to the laws of health. Then in the second place the want of any definite plan of mutual watchfulness, with regard to each other’s improvement, of a definite time and place for doing it with a firm determination to improve and be improved by each other — to confess our faults one to another and pray one for another that we may be healed… Yours with much love H.",1

"You bid me write short to you and I have much to say. You also bade me believe that it was a fancy which made me cherish an attachment  for you. It cannot be a fancy since you have been for the last year the object upon which every solitary moment led me to muse. I do not expect you to love me, I am not worthy of your love. I feel you are superior, yet much to my surprise, more to my happiness, you betrayed passions I had believed no longer alive in your bosom. Shall I also have to ruefully experience the want of happiness? Shall I reject it when it is offered? I may appear to you imprudent, vicious; my opinions detestable, my theory depraved; but one thing, at least, time shall show you: that I love gently and with affection, that I am incapable of anything approaching to the feeling of revenge or malice; I do assure you, your future will shall be mine, and everything you shall do or say, I shall not question.

"Dearest Bunny, Do you know what this is–a wedding anniversary letter. I think it should arrive about on the right date. Do you remember that hot  June day thirty-three years ago?–the church jammed–Father with a lovely waistcoat with small blue spots–the Rough Riders–the ushers in cutaways–the crowds in the street–your long white veil and tight little bodice–the reception at Aunt Harriet’s–Uncle Ed–your  mother with one of her extraordinary hats that stood straight up. And do you remember what the world was then–little and cozy–a different order of things, wars considered on the basis of a Dick  [Richard Harding] Davis novel, a sort of “As it was in the beginning” atmosphere over life. We’ve come a long way down a strange road since then. Nothing has happened as we imagined it would except our children. We never thought we’d roam the world. We never thought our  occupations and interests would cover such a range. We never thought that our thirty-third anniversary would find us deep in our  second war and me again at the front. Well, darling, we’ve lived up to the most important part of the ceremony, “In sickness and  in health, for richer for poorer, till death do you part.” Much, much love.",1

We must never forget those terrible, but so sweet, hours when you were close to me in the intervals of fighting. Let us remember all our lives that dark little room, the ancient hangings, the two armchairs, side by side, the meal we ate off the corner of the table, the cold chicken you had brought; our sweet converse, your caresses, your anxieties, your devotion.

My whole existence having once had you for its sole object, and all its thoughts, hopes, affections having, in their full harvest, been yours, it is utterly impossible that I should ever forget this–that I should ever forget that you were once my lover and are my husband and the father of my children.

I should like to call you by all the endearing epithets,  and yet I can find no lovelier word than the simple word ‘dear,’ but there is a particular way of saying it. My dear one, then,  I have wept for joy to think that you are mine, and often wonder if I deserve you. One would think that no one man’s heart and brain could stand all the things that are crowded into one day. Where do these thousands  of thoughts, wishes, sorrows, joys and hopes come from? Day in, day out, the procession goes on. But how light-hearted I was yesterday  and the day before! There shone out of your letters so noble a spirit, such faith, such a wealth of love!",1
"Dear Anna: Did I say that the human might be filed in categories? Well, and if I did, let me qualify — not all humans. You elude me. I cannot  place you, cannot grasp you. I may boast that of nine out of ten, under given circumstances, I can forecast their action; that of  nine out of ten, by their word or action, I may feel the pulse of their hearts. But of the tenth I despair. It is beyond me. You are  that tenth. Were ever two souls, with dumb lips, more incongruously matched! We may feel in common — surely, we oftimes do — and when we do not  feel in common, yet do we understand; and yet we have no common tongue. Spoken words do not come to us. We are unintelligible. God must  laugh at the mummery. The one gleam of sanity through it all is that we are both large temperamentally, large enough to often understand. True, we often  understand but in vague glimmering ways, by dim perceptions, like ghosts, which, while we doubt, haunt us with their truth. And still,  I, for one, dare not believe; for you are that tenth which I may not forecast. Am I unintelligible now? I do not know. I imagine so. I cannot find the common tongue. Large temperamentally — that is it. It is the one thing that brings us at all in touch. We have, flashed through us, you and I, each  a bit of universal, and so we draw together. And yet we are so different. I smile at you when you grow enthusiastic? It is a forgivable smile — nay, almost an envious smile. I have lived twenty-five years of  repression. I learned not to be enthusiastic. It is a hard lesson to forget. I begin to forget, but it is so little. At the best,  before I die, I cannot hope to forget all or most. I can exult, now that I am learning, in little things, in other things; but of my  things, and secret things doubly mine, I cannot, I cannot. Do I make myself intelligible? Do you hear my voice? I fear not. There are  poseurs. I am the most successful of them all.",1

"My Dearest Girl, I have been a walk this morning with a book in my hand, but as usual I have been occupied with nothing but you: I wish I could say in an agreeable manner. I am tormented day and night. They talk of my going to Italy. ‘Tis certain I shall never recover if I am to be so long separate from you: yet with all this devotion to you I cannot persuade myself into any confidence of you…. You are to me an object intensely desirable — the air I breathe in a room empty of you in unhealthy. I am not the same to you — no — you can wait — you have a thousand activities — you can be happy without me. Any party, anything to fill up the day has been enough. How have you pass’d this month? Who have you smil’d with? All this may seem savage in me. You do no feel as I do — you do not know what it is to love — one day you may — your time is not come…. I cannot live without you, and not only you but chaste you; virtuous you. The Sun rises and sets, the day passes, and you follow the bent of your inclination to a certain extent — you have no conception of the quantity of miserable feeling that passes through me in a day — Be serious! Love is not a plaything — and again do not write unless you can do it with a crystal conscience. I would sooner die for want of you than Yours for ever J. Keats",1
"Dear First Lady I know tradition has it that on this morning I place cards   Happy Anniversary cards on your breakfast tray.  But things are  somewhat mixed up.  I substituted a gift & delivered it a few weeks ago. Still this is the day, the day that marks 31 years of such happiness as comes to few men.  I told you once that it was like an  adolescent’s dream of what marriage should be like.  That hasn’t changed. You know I love the ranch but these last two days made it plain I only love it when you are there.  Come to think of it that’s  true of every place & every time.  When you aren’t there I’m no place, just lost in time & space. I more than love you, I’m not whole without you.  You are life itself to me.  When you are gone I’m waiting for you to return so  I can start living again. Happy Anniversary & thank you for 31 wonderful years. I love you Your Grateful Husband",1

"My love for you tonight is so deep and tender that it seems to be outside myself as well. I am fast shut up like a little lake  in the embrace of some big mountains. If you were to climb up the mountains, you would see me down below, deep and shining – and  quite fathomless, my dear. You might drop your heart into me and you’d never hear it touch bottom. I love you – I love you. Goodnight. Oh Bogey, what it is to love like this! PS.–while I was writing the last page, tear after tear fell on the paper. But I must cheer up — catch! — An astonishing  number of kisses are flying about — The deuce!– I see a whole crowd of them! Ha! Ha!…I have just caught three– They are delicious!–  You can still answer this letter, but you must address your reply to Linz, Poste Restante– That is the safest course. As I do not  yet know for certain whether I shall go to Regensburg, I can’t tell you anything definite. Just write on the cover that the letter  is to be kept until called for. Adieu–Dearest, most beloved little wife– Take care of your health– and don’t think of walking into town. Do write and tell  me how you like our new quarters– Adieu.  I kiss you millions of times.",1
"Love, …and now, love, you with the warm heart and loving eyes, whose picture I kissed last night and whose lips I so often kiss in my dreams, whose love enriches me so bountifully with all pleasant memories and sweet anticipations, whose encircling arms shield me from so much evil and harm, whose caresses are so dear and so longed for awake and in slumber, making my heart beat faster, my flesh tremble and my brain giddy with delight, – whose feet I kiss and whose knees I embrace as a devotee kisses and embraces those of his idol, – my darling whose home is in my arms and whose resting place my bosom, who first came to them as a frightened bird but now loves to linger there till long after the midnight chimes have uttered their warning, – my life, with your generous soul, my heart’s keeper and my true lover, – Good night: a good night and a fair one to thy sleeping eyes and wearied limb, the precursor of many bright, beautiful mornings when my kisses shall waken thee and my love shall greet thee.

"My will made by me, Laura Mary Octavia Lyttleton. I have not much to leave behind me, should I die next month, having my treasure deep in my heart where no one can reach it,  and where even death cannot enter… I want, first of all, to tell Alfred that all I have in the world and all I am and ever shall be, belongs to him more than anyone… So few women have been as happy as I have been every hour since I married – so few have had such a wonderful sky of love for their  common atmosphere, that perhaps it will seem strange when I write down that the sadness of death and parting is greatly lessened to  me by the fact of my consciousness of the eternal, indivisible oneness of Alfred and me. I feel as long as he is down here I must be here, silently, secretly sitting beside him as I do every evening now, however much my  soul is the other side, and that if Alfred were to die, we would be as we were on earth, love as we did this year, only fuller, quicker,  deeper than ever, with a purer passion and a wiser worship. Only in the meantime, whilst my body is hid from him and my eyes cannot see him, let my trivial toys be his till the morning comes when  nothing will matter because all is spirit.",1
"Personally? I think everything is based on personal merit. I've come up against several men of power in my life who are inherently sexist, but I have never failed to get what I wanted because I never let them regard me in a lower way. I think if you have enough respect for yourself and a general air of confidence, you can get most things done. This is probably because I grew up training horses with guys though. You can whine, bitch, and moan. I think women are definitely at a disadvantage because there is a high percentage who rely on being cute to get their way... which can work to an extent, but not in a way which will earn you any kind of respect in the future. More likely a pat on the head and a send her on her way. Dressed to Kill (or any DePalma). Cold. Dont be sad dear Eh den sat u book e kb liao huh...Was doing my test earlier. I appreciate you.

"You shall now receive (my dear wife) my last words in these my last lines. My love I send you that you may keep it when I am  dead, and my counsel that you may remember it when I am no more. I would not by my will present you with sorrows (dear Besse) let them go to the grave with me and be buried in the dust. And  seeing that it is not God’s will that I should see you any more in this life, bear it patiently, and with a heart like thy self. First, I send you all the thanks which my heart can conceive, or my words can rehearse for your many travails, and care taken for  me, which though they have not taken effect as you wished, yet my debt to you is not the less; but pay it I never shall in this world. Secondly, I beseech you for the love you bear me living, do not hide your self many days, but by your travails seek to help your  miserable fortunes and the right of your poor child. Thy mourning cannot avail me, I am but dust… Remember your poor child for his father’s sake, who chose you, and loved you in his happiest times. Get those letters which I wrote  to the Lords, wherein I sued for my life; God is my witness it was for you and yours that I desired life, but it is true that I  disdained my self for begging of it: for know it that your son is the son of a true man, and one who in his own respect despiseth  death and all his misshapen and ugly forms. I cannot write much, God he knows how hardly I steal this time while others sleep, and it is also time that I should separate my  thoughts from the world. Beg my dead body which living was denied thee; and either lay it at Sherburne or in Exeter Church, by my  Father and Mother; I can say no more, time and death call me away….

Consider how I love you; what would I not renounce or  enterprise for you? I much have you mine, or I am miserable, and nothing but knowing which shall be the happy hour can make the rest of my years that  are to come tolerable. Give me a word or two of comfort, or resolve never to look on me more, for I cannot bear a kind look and after  it a cruel denial.

"My Darling Josephine: Am nearly through with my writing. Am brain weary with the thousand and one imperative details and things  to think of. Everything thus far has gone well, too well I am afraid, and I am (solely on general principles) somewhat suspicious  of the future. The ship is in better shape than before; the party and crew are apparently harmonious; I have 21 Eskimo men  (against 23 last time) but the total of men women and children is only 50 as against 67 before owing to a more careful selection  as to children… I have landed supplies here, and leave two men ostensibly on behalf of Cook. As a matter of fact I have established here the sub-base which last I established at Victoria Head, as a precaution in event of  loss of the Roosevelt either going up this fall or coming down next summer. In some respects this is an advantage as on leaving  here there is nothing to delay me or keep me from taking either side of the Channel going up. the conditions give me entire control  of the situation… You have been with me constantly, sweetheart. At Kangerdlooksoah I looked repeatedly at Ptarmigan Island and thought of the time we  camped there. At Nuuatoksoah I landed where we were. And on the 11th we passed the mouth of Bowdoin Bay in brilliant weather, and as  long as I could I kept my eyes on Anniversary Lodge. We have been great chums dear. Tell Marie to remember what I told her, tell  “Mister Man” [Robert Peary, Jr.] to remember “straight and strong and clean and honest”, obey orders, and never forget that Daddy  put “Mut” in his charge till he himself comes back to take her. In fancy I kiss your dear eyes and lips and cheeks sweetheart; and  dream of you and my children, and my home till I come again. Kiss my babies for me. Aufwiedersehen. Love, Love, Love.

To Fanny Brawne: I cannot exist without you – I am forgetful of every thing but seeing you again – my life seems to stop there – I see no further. You have absorb’d me. I have a sensation at the present moment as though I were dissolving ….I have been astonished that men could die martyrs for religion –  I have shudder’d at it – I shudder no more – I could be martyr’d for my religion – love is my religion – I could die for that – I could die for you. My creed is love and you are its only tenet – you have ravish’d me away by a power I cannot resist. John Keats,1

I wouldn't know where to turn if I didn't have you. You are this girl's dream come true.I wish you could feel all the passion and all the love that I carry around for you. You have won my heart and soul. You have won it all. You make me feel like I am in heaven--in the arms of an angel. You and I have a fulfilling relationship, but as it goes on, I wonder which is it--friends or lovers? That is not certain yet.

I felt love the first time I looked at you, and my world became a beautiful place to live in. I often ask myself, what in the world would I do without you now? I hope to never find out the answer to that question.My love, my beautiful love, come and answer ""yes"" to my proposal and make me the happiest man in the world! If you love me, too, then marry me!

And when I do think of you, the biggest smile comes across my face.I feel warm all over, and my heart skips a beat whether we're on the phone or just in the same room.

"I am writing you this letter to tell you how much you mean to me, and to thank you for coming into my life. You are something I never thought could exist for me. You are the best thing that has ever happened in my life, and I don't regret telling you how I feel.I have been through many relationships, but didn't really take any of them seriously. I was used and abused by a guy who I really loved once. So I decided to play guys the same way that guys had played me. I wasn't born nasty; a guy made me this way. Since then I have not taken chances with a guy again. But you happened; you came into my life and stole my heart away from the day I met you.At first I was confused. I didn't really know what I wanted. I didn't know if I wanted to take a chance again and actually take you seriously. So, I decided to come close to you as a friend and find out who you truly were first and what you were really like. You seemed cool, nice, and funny--some things I really liked in a guy. So I took a chance and got together with you.In the beginning, things didn't seem to go very well. I actually had my doubts about you, and I wasn't sure you were actually taking me seriously. But it was too late to turn back. I had already fallen for you from the day I first met you, and I wasn't really looking forward to giving up so soon. I tried so hard to know you. I wasn't going to let you go so easily!Well, time has passed, and I have discovered new things about a new me. You have truly changed me. Still, I'm scared, because I'm growing a deep feeling inside my heart that I just can't explain. I truly don't know what your feelings are, but I don't want to force you to tell me something you don't really feel towards me. I want to receive love and trust from you when you truly mean it. All I ask of you is to show me that you care for me, and to also trust me the way I trust you.",1
"You've got me dreaming about you now. I think of you every second of every day. I can't help it; you have become a part of my world and it's a little scary because I haven't depended on anyone like this for a long time. I would trust you with anything--with everything. I pray that you never do anything to make me regret this. Yes, now I can honestly say that I love you and will always love you because we seem to be soul mates. You say that we were meant for each other and I know that it's true because you say that you love me too.",1
"Right after we met, my love, I should have told you this: there's this special love that I have deep within my heart. That love is only for you. It is far greater than this world. I wish I could show you how much you really mean to me. If I could only let you feel how much I really do love you in a kiss or a hug, you would begin to feel the love that I have for you. I will only be able to show you how much I really do love you when we get married. Then you will really know how much I love you. You can hear the sound of my love, though, just by listening to my heart. You can taste the sweetness of my love in a kiss; you can feel it in my embrace.If I could describe the love that I have for you and use lyrics of love songs and even the sonnets of Shakespeare, it would still be impossible, because the love that I love for you cannot be put into words. You've had my love from the day we met, and you will have it forever. As time goes by, my heart and love for you will keep growing stronger, brighter, and bigger.Call me your love from this day forward. You are fully mine, as I pray I am fully yours. Although we have two different minds, and souls, we have one and the same beautiful heart. My love is unconditional.I love you with all my heart, body, and soul. I will never stop loving you. You are my life, my world, and everything to me. Distance may keep us apart, but you will always and forever be embedded deep within my heart.",1
"I wake up every morning thinking of you and then I roll over and see your smiling face. I know we can disagree, and I can make you mad, but you still love me with everything you have. I was scared to love you at first, in fear that you would hurt me, but I did anyway, and it's the best choice I ever made. Now, the only fear I have is waking up and rolling over and finding out you were only a dream. If this is a dream world, Baby, then don't wake me up because you're the one and only for me. I love you with everything I have and would give you the very clothes off my back. I love you with all my heart.",1
"My heart is hungry for your love, but my mind is aware of what it cannot have. I know we belong to different worlds, so then why did you come and change everything in my life? I thought I didn't want to love again. I thought I wouldn't be able to because my heart has been hurt so much. To even say, ""I do""--it's a scary thought, but you came along, and I suddenly became fearless.It's hard to explain myself or to put it together in one idea; the only easy course is my loving you. For just one look into your eyes makes everything in the world and in my life seem to glow. You make me want to see the sunrise every day, to know it's another day where I could have you by my side. I know faith can make this work someday if I just keep my hopes up. Until then I'll think of you just like now. Your touch will forever caress me with tenderness, and your kisses will keep the flame in my heart alive. I hope that one day soon you and I will be together again.",1
"My darling, sweet Prince--where do I begin?As always, I want to start by saying, ""thank you."" I tell you a million times a day, each day, that I love you and that you mean the world to me. Although you reciprocate some of these feelings, I'm sure you have no inkling of the strength of my love. My love for you is strong!You walked into my life a stranger a mere eight months ago, and my life hasn't been the same since. You are TRULY my gift from a higher power. ""Love"" is such a small word for what we share. You are amazing. You came into my life when I was at a low point: a time when I thought that the pain brought on by someone else would never end. During the moments I tried to turn away for fear of the unknown, you dug your heels into the ground and looked deep into my soul and stayed. You compromised your life and your goals to help me survive, and I owe much to you. Without you I could not even go on.You have become a beacon to me. Whenever I feel as though I've drifted too far into the discouragement that clouds my life, I can look up to find you guiding me to safety. I stay here, not because this place is home, but because YOU are home.After all that's happened to me in the past three years, I swore that I could never settle down again--that I could never give my heart and life completely to someone again. With great content and zero disparity, I take it all back.Most people will spend their entire lives searching for a perfection that almost never exists. Most people will spend their days looking at each person they encounter with questions as to whether or not they have found a reason, a season, or a lifetime. With you I have found an eternity. This is where I was meant to be. You are what my entire life has led up to. You are my very best friend, my lover, my protector, my teacher, and my one and only soul mate.I give my life to you--mind, body, and soul. I want you to hold me for the rest of my life as you do now, each and every night.I belong to you from this moment on.",1
"I wish I could read your beautiful mind and see if you really love me. I know I love you with all my heart, but I have no idea if you feel the same way. My heart is ready to split in two because I need you, and yet I don't know if you need me. Please, from the bottom of my heart, I confess my everlasting love to you and hope that you feel the same way. Please give me an answer.",1
"Baby, I don't even know where to begin! From the first time we talked to each other, I knew you were special. Words cannot even express how I felt the first time we met. It seemed so natural, like we'd known one another for years. Truth is, it's been just under six weeks. I never knew I could feel this strongly about someone this soon, but you proved me wrong. Every time I see the beach or a sunset, I think about that night. Actually, I think about that day and night all the time.It's hard for me to tell you how I feel, because no one in my previous relationships has wanted what we have. And if they had, I was afraid to tell them I cared because I was afraid of being hurt. Please bear with me, I'm working on it. I will slowly be able to tell you how I feel and what I'm thinking.I read this quote today and it's made me think: ""The best way to love is to love like you've never been hurt."" That fits my situation 100 percent. I kept dwelling on the past and what everyone else has done to me. After reading those words, I realized I cannot be with you and be happy and still dwell on what other guys have done to me. I am with you--not them. I need to concentrate on making you happy and letting you make me happy. Up until this point, you've been different than any other guy. I know that you wouldn't hurt me, at least intentionally. That's why you are different. I know you care about me and want to be with me. I am sorry I have doubted that before. There has not been a moment in the past six weeks when I have doubted my feelings for you.You've walked into my life and totally turned it around. I was so depressed and torn up about what had happened to me in the last year or so that I was ready to give up. You gave me the hope that I needed to keep on going. I am so grateful for having you in my life. I've been waiting for someone just like you to walk into my life. Thank you for everything.One last thing before I go. I have wanted to tell you something, but have not been able to bring myself to do so--I love you!",1
"Every night when I close my eyes, thoughts of you fill me with joy. Every morning when I open my eyes, you're the first thought on my mind. I am certain that I am in love with you. I want to hold you, kiss you and to feel your body near me. If you'll be mine, you'll make me the happiest woman in the world. If you turn me away, I don't know if I can take it. But either way, you'll always be the greatest love I've ever had.",1
"I love you so much, and you don't even know it. Sometimes I get scared about showing it. It feels like when you come around me, my mouth locks tight, and the words I want to say are just stifled. My lips lock up because my love is so strong, and the words that I want to say just can't be expressed. Sometimes I want to open up and tell you how I feel, but I guess I'm just too scared. I know you love me, and you have feelings hidden inside, too. It seems like it isn't any easier for you to express yourself to me, than for me to express myself to you. I love you, so please know that I always will.",1
"I don't know how to start, because I'm afraid it might be the end of our good relationship or, if I'm lucky, it could be the realization of my dreams, which is for you to love me as I love you. I told myself, I might as well take the risk because it's the only remedy I know of that could let loose this feeling I've been keeping inside me all this time.I love you. I know you'll find it hard to believe me if I tell you how much you mean to me. I hardly understand what I feel for you, and don't know how these long, sleepless nights, thinking only of you can go one. I've never felt like this before. I don't know how to pour out my feelings for you now. I wanted to find the perfect words to make you realize how much I need you and love you, but words continue to elude me; what could they be? Something poetic? I'm sure it should be heartfelt and out of the ordinary. I'm afraid it's no use. Every time I look at you, the words come out the same--I love you!",1
"Our road to friendship has been a little less than conventional, but it has worked for us. I know you will always be there for me. That's one of the reasons I think I may be falling in love with you.I know you do not have time for a relationship right now and that you may even be afraid to commit to me, but I am patient. I will be by your side, regardless of my status with you. I have never felt so attached to a person in my life. I love talking to you or just being around you.I also realize that it is hard to tell somebody that you do not love them as they love you. Please, don't ever be afraid to be honest with me, because I will always be your friend.Mainly, I wanted you to know I will wait for you. I don't need fancy gifts or all of your time. All I need is to know you care, and I believe you do already. I love your hugs and encouraging words, and I want to say, ""thank you"" for everything. I have loved you as my friend for a while now, and I would love to love you even more.",1
"I've kept my feelings for you contained as long as I can. I am in love with you, and true, honest love should not be contained and kept quiet forever. There is so much about you that most girls don't see. They only see the physical. They see your body, but my love for you is more than skin deep. My feelings for you grow every day, and my love grows deeper with every passing minute. You mean so much to me. Just seeing your smiling face or hearing you heart-melting voice brightens up my worst days and makes them more than just bearable. Just having a hug from you makes me feel warm and cozy inside. I dream of you day in and day out; you're the only one on my mind now. I am in love with you and have been in love with you since I can't remember when!",1
"When I was a little girl, I dreamed of that one person with whom I would share my dreams, happiness, and life. I could not see his face, but he was there. I always felt he was out there. I just needed to find him. I visualized the bond we would have and the courage he would give me to get through life's obstacles. All these years that I have been with others, feeling my way through life, learning lessons that later on would prepare me to become the person I am now. I've been sad and alone. Then one day I saw clearly that he was finally here. Here in my world was the man that I had dreamed of and had hoped I would not miss meeting in life--that man is you.",1
"This letter is my heart-template in which my burning feelings for you will finally be expressed. If you can remember, I sat by your side at the Public Library, only two days ago.I really enjoyed the special moments I spent with you at the library. You struck me as being mild-mannered and sophisticated. In fact, your elevated words added some seasoning to my life. Sitting by your side that day, I was totally captivated by your charm and good looks. If you noticed, I was not wholeheartedly doing the assignment given to me. You were my total preoccupation, believe me. I wondered why I should ever get carried away by somebody I hadn't met before. Are there any particular things that I was hungry for that I found in you? I don't know. I just quickly realized how exquisitely beautiful and unique you are. Your long, wavy hair, tied back with a ribbon, really intoxicated me. I must confess, I have fallen in love with you, my dear. I watched myself slowly gravitate towards you. Since that day, it appears that our lives can be like the lives of the world's famous lovers.To me, you're a rose that should be protected from thorns, a delicate angel who needs a defender. To be your defender, I promise that I'll do whatever it takes to make you happy and keep you safe.I'm serious when I say, ""I love you."" I usually rhapsodize about your outstanding natural beauty to my friends. Your beauty hit me with a force of a poetic sledgehammer. I love you and cherish you. You're an angel personified.I'm longing to wrap my arms around you to soothe my aching heart. I just need you to say, ""I do.""",1
"You are the only one who can make me happy with your love and affection. Since I met you, I have noticed that life is worth living. I live mine just for you. You have stolen my heart from me. Alone I am lost. Please, do not let the distance between us become larger. Each day is more wonderful than the previous one, if I spend it with you. The closer you get to me, it seems the more I love you. A heart truly in love never loses hope but always believes in the promise of love, no matter how long the time and how far the distance. There are so many ways I want to tell you that I really love you. My feelings for you are true and pure, like your kind heart. I have tried many times to confess this to you, but you always turn a deaf ear to what I say. Remember one thing--I love you and will always love you.",1
"I have lived for a long time, responsible for and dependent upon no one, answering to no one and committed to no one except myself. During this period of my life, I considered the world mine for the taking and truly believed that I was living life to the fullest. Then you came into the picture and, all of a sudden, I realized that I was deceiving myself.I find that my life is not all that I thought it was. In fact, it is terribly lacking in many things, the foremost being love. Now, through some great fortune, I have found that love and, along with it, the one person who can make my life truly complete.You are that person, and I have fallen in love with you. To be honest, I never thought I would ever utter those words, but now they come forth effortlessly and with great sincerity. I'll be forever grateful to you for showing me just how shallow my life was. At last, I have a chance now to give it depth and purpose.Until I hear from you, I remain totally yours in thought and spirit.",1
"I just hope you read this letter. You know I've tried every other way to tell you how I feel about you except using the phrase, ""I love you."" I'm doing this to avoid you being embarrassed. I can say I'm not 100% sure you feel the same way as I do now. Maybe the distance between us now is making things more difficult. I do believe, my love, that if by coincidence you read this mail, you know I am saying this to you: I love you and always will. I can't help but tell you this.",1
"I have spent my life waiting--not living, not loving, just waiting for the one that would inspire me to be all I can be, to live up to all my possibilities, to reach every goal, to know that I may fail sometime, but I will never be alone. You brought to my cold, empty heart a passion only you could bring. Your words of acceptance and love have soothed the aching in my empty heart, and now I am at peace with myself and the world around me. I knew that one day when I found you, my waiting would be over. I love you with every ounce of my being. Yours is the first name I call out in the morning, and the last one I whisper at night.",1
"Every time I see you, I think I'm out of control. I do not know why I am feeling this way, but it's like nothing I've ever experienced before. I'd like to touch your face to see if it's real. How could I not notice until now that your face could launch a thousand ships?I'd like you to know that I love you so much, more than I have ever loved anyone. I just want to stay with you while I can for as long as you'll let me.",1
"I don't know what happened to me, whether I was crazy or just lonely. All I know is I was sick of being deceived, mistreated, and unappreciated. Then you came along, I don't know why. All I know is that I felt a connection on our first chat, something I had never felt before that at first made me feel uneasy, stupid, and even a bit childish. It put me go through all kinds of emotions as we chatted on line and I began finding we had a lot in common. I felt like we knew each other from an unknown past.At first I was scared, and a part of me wanted to believe that you were just someone who was playing a game. I was thinking I was crazy to have the feelings I was beginning to have for you. I was really upset with myself and became very angry with the way I was feeling. I didn't want to admit to you or to anyone else that I was falling for someone I had never actually met. I thought I was becoming insane myself. I tried to fight these feelings off, but they were just too powerful for me to ignore! I tried to convince myself that this can't be for real; that you couldn't REALLY be feeling the same as I was. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't fight the feelings I was having for you.Then the night came when you expressed how you were beginning to feel that which I tried not to believe, because I was scared of being disappointed. The magnetism that I was feeling was so strong, though, that I could no longer fight it. Our chats became an every day thing, and the feelings just wouldn't go away, no matter how hard I tried to ignore them.I just could not resist the temptation of meeting you while I was on vacation near you. All along, I could not believe you were for real, but when we finally first met, I knew there was no way I could stop loving you. I thought that if we met, these feelings would just go away, but they didn't. I tried so hard to convince myself that there is no such thing as true love, but you have made me believe differently.We have been together for nearly nine months now, and I still love you and even more so now. You have become a part of me that I will always cherish. I love you with all my heart, forever and always. You have brought me so much happiness.",1
"I'm so in love. I get this warm feeling every time I think of you. When I sleep at night, all I dream about is you. I wish I could wrap my arms around you and kiss your sweet lips. I wish I could feel the warmth of you near me. I ask you to let me be the one you love; let me be the one you need.",1
"We met at work and, in the beginning, you were just someone I worked with. Months passed and all of a sudden my attitude towards you changed and I started to think about you all the time. Our circumstances inhibit us from being together now, but I can't stop obsessing over you. I've never felt like this before, and I don't know what to do. I guess this is a letter recognizing my deep love for you, but at the same I wonder how it can be. I love you with all my heart, and today I have the courage to tell you.",1
"Hey! I've noticed that you've been flirting with me lately. At least it seems that way. You make it obvious that you really like me. I know I really like you. I want to know if you like me as much as I do you. If you do, please tell me so. I wish that you would be mine and that I could be yours. If you think this is love, please tell me. I want you to be mine.Every time I'm around you, you make my heart melt. My heart beats faster than a hummingbird's wings. I love you more than anything I know. You've got the most endearing smile in the world! I love you so much!I love you and will love you forever. I hope you love me. If you do, please tell me so.",1
"I just had to let you know that these last two days without talking to you have given me time to think about how I really feel about you. I have decided that I am definitely, hopelessly, in love with you. What made me realize this is not because I think about you all the time, although I do. It was how I think about you. Not only do I think about how much I love you, but why, how much, and mostly if I deserve you to love me.It feels so lucky to finally be able to love you like I have been wanting to for so long. Your sweet lips leave me speechless with each tender kiss. What have I done to deserve this? And that is another thing I was thinking. It is a little too strange, I think, that we are so right for each other. Some might want to argue about it, but I have a few examples to offer those poor, misguided souls. Your smile is like a world-famous painting. When we kiss, it is like two lost puzzle pieces finally found after a long search that make the picture complete. When we hold each other, time seems to stand still. When I look into your eyes, I see the love in your heart. All of this tells me one thing--our love is true and real.",1
"We can never be--why? Because we are just friends, really good friends, and you don't want to ruin that, but then you kissed me!You said that it meant nothing, and that you have too much respect for our friendship. I could show you that our being together could be amazing. I don't want to hurt you like you have been hurt in the past. I want you to take a risk and learn that being together can be great!I know that things could never be the same again, but that's what life is all about--taking risks! I could make you so happy, if you'd just let me try. There's more to life than just sitting around waiting for something to happen. We need to jump onto a good thing and let our feelings fly.I love you, and if you have not seen that by now, then you are blind. I used to think it was just your looks, but then I realized it's who you are inside that makes my heart beat at this pace. Just being around you makes my life worth living. You will be in my heart forever even if it's just as friends.I'll love you always!",1
"Wow, I don't even know where to start. I don't know if you even think about me but you make my heart pound so fast that it's hard to catch my breath. When I think of us getting together, I get goose bumps all over. You're all I think about now. I've never had a love like this before or felt this way. I want to keep you forever.",1
"My heart has found its way to you with all my love. I want you and no one else because you mean everything to me. I think we should try and make this work. I hope you know you're the one and only one that I want. You're the perfect friend, and I hope we can and will grow to be more. I could never ask for better than what we already have. I hope you're feeling the same way because my heart is set on you and only you, Baby.",1
"It has not been long since we met, but everything has changed in my life. I experience more excitement and feel like the happiest man on the earth. I also think about you all the time. It is not just at bedtime, or upon waking up, but at my work, when I drive, and at all times. Sometimes I sit and, without any reason, call your name out loud, until I realize that you are far away, and then I just smile at the sweet thought of you.When I talk to you, it makes my heart beat faster, and I feel sweet feelings, unexplainable, not understandable. I feel your presence everywhere near me, your laugh echoes in my ears, your talks remind me that you really exist, and I want you as much as the roses would need their perfume, like wind needs its song, like snow needs its whiteness, like a little child wants ice cream. I did not plan to love you, it just happened.The world has many beauties: some are lilies, jasmines, irises, roses; some were just simple, plain flowers; none of them attracts me. It was your innocent smile, your sparkling eyes. It was like lightening had struck me, it was like an angel had appeared to me. It was you and your love that made me what I am today.I will love you as long as the sun keeps shining, the stars keep brightening the sky, the winds keep blowing, the snow keeps falling, and the flowers keep smiling. I humbly ask that you be mine.Loving you forever,",1
"Every morning I wake up smiling, just because you're beside me. I listen to your breathing and feel the warmth and comfort of just knowing that you're there. My favorite part of the day is when you roll over and hold me. That feeling remains with me all through the day and lasts until the following morning when we do it all over again. I never want that feeling to end. So I write this to you to let you know of my strong love for you.",1
"Since the day I first met you, you captivated me! The first time that our lips touched, you touched my soul. You have given me more than I could ever imagine receiving from one person. I cherish the love that we share together and, most of all, I cherish you! You are my inspiration and my determination. I love you with all my heart!",1
"How I wish words could express the thoughts that I have about you. If I should say, ""I love you,"" then the greater percent of my feelings would still be unexpressed. But of course, I must say something. My heart longs for you, and I must tell you that. I long to see your face and to hear your voice. Just thinking of you helps make my day a better one.",1
"Perhaps you will be astonished that you are receiving a letter from me. I just want you to know that a letter is more eloquent than words. That is why these words will definitely speak for themselves. I am a little confused on how to erase your beautiful and charming face from my mind. The more time I spend with you, the more I like everything about you, and the more I want to find out all about you--how you think, how you feel, what your dreams are, and everything wonderful about you. If I could only do something just to persuade you to care for me.Everything I wish to do is more difficult because of this unexplainable emotion. I promised myself before not to see you anymore or to talk to you--just to forget you, but these promises never materialized. My admiration has still been bubbling within me these long, lonely days.I may be able to fool others, but I cannot fool myself. I would be a great liar if I said that I'm not in love with you. No matter what you think or say, all I can say is, I really love you with all my heart. If you will give me just a little time to prove my feelings to you and that I deserve your feelings, I will work hard at winning you. I can barely endure the extreme anxiety and the sleepless nights I have experienced lately.Since I met you, I felt I was living in a new and wonderful world--one full of love. The sun became brighter, the grass greener, and everything I do became more meaningful. You should remember that I will cherish you always. Such love, like everything worthwhile, deserves to be given attention and care in order for it to continue to grow. I hope you agree with me.",1
"I don't know how to approach this with you in person. Every day I fight a battle with myself in which my heart says I should tell you how I feel, but my head tells me not to be stupid. It would just cause damage to our friendship, and that you wouldn't be interested. I am not totally discounting the possibility that my feelings could be reciprocated, but as I have had very little luck with you in the past, my hopes are fairly small.I know there is probably very little I can say to change your mind either way. I do feel that given the chance, this could turn into more, but I guess that would depend on you, and how you feel about me.I can't pinpoint what it is, exactly, that makes me feel that you do have some feelings towards me. Maybe it's due to the way that when I talk to you, how you nearly always look me in the eyes; so few people do that anymore. Your eyes seem to speak to me.I wish I could vocalize my feelings to you, but my fears prohibit me from doing so. I think that by the time I finally gain the courage, you will have found the person you are looking for. My biggest fear is that if I would tell you, then I would see a look of fear or horror on your face that would break me.I wish I could tell you how every time you don't turn up for work, I fear that I will never see you again. When I see you, and sometimes you look down, I wish you would open up to me and let me into your life. I know it wouldn't be easy, but I still believe that I could be good for you, if only you could return my feelings. I know I may not be the best-looking man you know, and I don't have much to offer you financially. All I could offer you is my heart and soul.I fear this will not turn out the way I hope, but I pray that it does. As I said before, you may never know the true extent of my feelings, although I imagine you have some suspicions what they might be.This may be a crush or an infatuation but, I swear to you, it does not feel like it. I have had crushes before, but never really felt the depth of emotion I do for you.I hope that if I can muster the courage to tell you how I feel that, whether or not you can reciprocate, it will turn out okay, and that at the very least we can be good friends. I do long for so much more, though.",1
"You are my ""knight in shinning armor."" I wouldn't be where I am today, if it weren't for you reaching out and helping me. I will never forget you or the things you have done for me. You are the ""best"" in my eyes and in my heart. I love every moment we've spent and the small talks we've shared. I do hope that one day our friendship will grow into love. No matter whatever becomes of ""us,"" I will always hold you in my heart.",1
"You're the last thing on my mind at night. You fill my every dream. You're the very first thing I think of when I wake up--and you don't know it. So, I am confessing my love to you.I always miss you when you're gone. I miss you when you're sitting close to me. I miss you when I can't see you smile. I miss you any day that you're not here.I want you like you'll never know. I want you, body and soul. I see your face, I want your heart. I want your love, I NEED your love, but I won't tell you because I can't. I can't tell you how I feel, because I know you're just my friend. I know that you're happy with that. I know you're not looking for someone to love. I know. But, I don't understand.I want a day when it's just you and me. I want a day when my heart can tell you how I feel. I pray every day that you'll tell me that you want me the same way I want you. I beg every day to that unseen force that you will one day be mine.I'm moving away, but I'm leaving my heart with you. Forever and for always, my heart will belong to you. My heart NEEDS you. So please love me or leave me.Forever and a day,",1
"When we first met, I'll never forget how you walked over to me and just started talking and you made me feel comfortable. It started out with a great friendship that has lasted almost two years now. In that time, we've had a lot of good talks and good times together.After these months of knowing you, I knew that I loved you, and that I always wanted to be with you. I had wished so hard that one day I would have a chance to be with you. Finally, I got up the nerve to tell you how I felt about you. Now I can talk to you and tell you anything because I trust you.I love you so much, and my wish finally came true last Saturday, when you first said that you loved me. My heart lifted because it felt so good inside to finally hear the words I had been longing to hear. We had been friends longer than we had been boyfriend and girlfriend. I'm so in love with you now. I promise you this: I will never lie or do anything to hurt you. You make me feel good inside and so happy, too. It's amazing being with you because you're such an amazing person. I don't know what the future holds--that's something only heaven knows. I just know that love you, and I know that I always will.",1
"This is not a sudden urge that has prompted me to write to you. When I first met you, I was struck by your warmth and by your sweetness of manner and speech. It soon became difficult for me to shut you out of my mind. Your bewitching smile captivated my heart. The more I tried to forget you, the more I began to think about you, until it dawned upon me that I had fallen in love with you. I've gotten the chance to know you in our swimming class, and I want you to know you've captured my heart. I know this is not right for me to tell you all these things so soon, but I can't help it.After we parted company last night, I had wonderful memories that filled my heart as I walked along the path that led home. Thanks for filling the emptiness in my heart. You're an angel in disguise that came down from heaven to brighten my life.Now that I've found you, I promise to take good care of you. Even though I don't know what your true feelings are, I'll still love you the best way I can. Thank you for those things that you've done for me. If the time comes when you find someone you love better than me, just let me know; even though it hurts, I'll set you free.",1
"You are the reason for my smiles. You are the reason for my tears and the reason for my fears. You, my love, are the reason I wake up each day and go to sleep each night. You are my life. You, my love, are the only reason for my happiness. I love you; I want you; I need you! Life would be incomplete without you. You have given me your love, and I now give you my heart. It is yours to do with as you may, Remember, my love, I am always yours!",1
"I am still on my knees begging for love, not to a stranger, but to the love I know--you. I've been in love and know its mystery. Each night and day I hope and pray that you'll be mine forever more. After what you've been through, it'll be hard for you to trust again--giving your heart and soul to another's keeping, but know it's me that's on my knees, swallowing my pride, begging you, please--once again, I say, ""please,"" be mine.",1
"I'm writing to let you know how I feel about you. I don't know how to tell you face to face, so I am going to put my feelings into words now. Since the day I met you, I haven't been the same. My feelings just can't be tamed. I am starting to care for you in a different way. I think of you every day! I love everything about you! Your smile, your eyes, your hair, your body--I hope you are getting the point. I can't get you off my mind. You have me feeling foolish. I know you may not feel the same, but my feelings just keep growing for you each and every day. Well, what I am trying to tell you is that I am falling in love with you--yes, this is true! But I'll understand it if you don't feel the same. I just have to let you know how I really feel. This is no whim; my feelings are real and genuine.",1
"I know we haven't gotten to know each other for very long, and there is a bit of an age difference between us, but I do really care about you. You are a very special guy. There is so much about you that I know most girls don't see. They are all looking at you just for your body. But, Honey, I am telling you, that is not what I am doing. There is so much more to you than that. I have liked you for a very long time now, but just never had the courage to say it to you. Well, that has all changed now, and I am going to say it. I really care a lot about you, and I would like to be a lot more than just friends. You mean so much to me. I mean, just that special smile when I'm having a bad day just brightens the day and makes it bearable. Or just to have you give me a hug comforts me. Just to see your smiling face brightens the darkest day. So, what do you say, would you like to give it a go?",1
"I want to tell you that I need you here with me from now on. I live day to day thinking about you. I picture everything about you in my mind, as if you were really here beside me. When I fall asleep, I dream of you, and I can feel you near me.My world is spinning and I can't sleep. My throat closes whenever you speak. My heart bursts just being around you. I take note of your every word, your every movement. My eyes drop down whenever you look at me with that bashful smile. This tension is tearing me apart.How can I get closer to you? I'm too shy to talk to you, so right now it feels safer to watch you from afar and not be rejected. You have a place in my mind. I wish you'd tell me everything I want to hear, but haven't yet. I want you to tell me that you want me, but I haven't heard that yet. Every time I think of you, I can feel the butterflies fluttering inside me. You don't notice me or the way I look at you; maybe it's because you only see me as a friend and nothing more. I wish I knew.At night I lay in bed and dream of you coming to my door, pulling me to you and holding me tight. I imagine whispering in your ear how much I want you. I want you to hold me. I need to hear your voice. I imagine being wrapped in your arms and then pressed tightly against you. I want you to make me feel a part of you. Every time we touched, I would feel like we're the only ones in existence.But as I sit here, watching the sun drop slowly into the horizon, my heart sinks with it. When will I learn? You would never want me. I'm not perfect, beautiful, or anything important. I will have to let go the dream of you and me together.Your secret love,",1
"Compliments of the season to you! Hope everything is fine where you are. I don't even know where to start, but I know I will work this out. When I set my eyes on you, I fell in love with you. I want to tell you why but I don't know where to start, and that is the reason why I decided to write to you.Do you know how much I appreciate having someone like you in my life, someone to share my good times with and tell my troubles to, someone to care about? All my life, I prayed for someone like you, someone who would treat me as well as my mother does, like my sister does. If you will take up a special space in my life, I will always love you, and my love for you will never die.I know that all I will ever think of is loving you, for I know that this is the only way to express my feelings for you. I wonder how things would have turned out if I had not met you and not told you how I felt? But I did and I will say a thousand times that I love you.When we love someone, we want to be loved, too. Love can sometimes be painful, but love is also sweeter than the honey in the honeycomb. I love you, and so I say it.Oh, you may be surprised, because this is the only way to express my secret love for you. Please, when you read this, mail me back, so I will know how you feel.",1
"I'm writing this letter to explain to you how I feel. I am starting to fall for you, and it is driving me crazy, because I can't seem to tell you how I really feel. I need to know where I stand in your life, and if it could ever be more than what we are now. I'm starting to develop strong feelings towards you, and I don't know why.I love your eyes, your smile, your hair, your body, and your voice--it drives me off the wall! When I hear your voice, my heart skips a beat. I am crazy about you.I need to know how you feel about me. Could you possibly feel the same towards me, or can this never be? I just want you to be mine. I want to be able to say that you're my guy. Well, now you know that I am secretly falling in love with you. I just wish I could hear those same words from you. Maybe one day I will, but until then I guess all I can do is wait. Please, don't make me wait too long!I had to get the courage to tell you how I feel.",1
"Hey, there is so much I want to tell you, a lot has been running through my head lately. I'm having trouble putting my thoughts into words, so you will have to bear with me through this.I keep thinking about the future, about life, and what I want out of it. I keep thinking about us and what this relationship means to me. I keep thinking about these things and I realize they go hand in hand. This relationship is my future; it is what I want out of life. I want to grow old with you. I want to experience this crazy love forever and ever, and I really think I'm going to.I want us to walk through new houses, picking the one that would be just right for us. I want to see you walk around our house in a big t-shirt with your hair down and catch me staring at how gorgeous you are. I want you to pull the covers off me at night and then I would have to get even closer, if possible, to keep warm. I want to see you laugh like crazy at me when I do stupid stuff. I want to rub lotion all over your body because you were in the sun too long. I want to have a child with you and go through the experiences of parenthood with you. I want to see you and me chasing our little kid around the house, all three of us laughing our heads off and having fun. I want to hold you when you cry and smile with you when you smile. I want to fall asleep every night with you in my arms. I want you to fall asleep on my chest listening to the beat of my heart and know it beats for you. I want you to be the first thing I see when I wake up and the last thing I see when I go to sleep. I want to see your bad morning hair. I want to sit on the beach with you and watch the sun set, and I want all the people who pass us by to envy the obvious love we have for each other.I want to see you walk down that aisle and I want to take your hand for the rest of my life. I want to spend all night and maybe the next day making love to you with an undying passion. I want to be forty years old and still make out with you like a young schoolboy. I want to cook a meal with you and totally ruin it and end up having to order take out. I want to sit there talking to you for hours about nothing--but at the same time everything--or maybe we won't talk at all, just grin at each other, realizing how lucky we are. I want you to get mad at me for doing something stupid, and I want you to burst out laughing when you try to yell at me, but can't stay angry at me.I want to lay with you in front of a fireplace and keep the heat going long after the fire goes out. I want to take trips with you to places we've never been before and experience them together. I want us to go skinny-dipping in a hotel pool and get caught and streak back to our hotel room, waking everyone up because we're laughing so hard. I want us to go and pick out the hot tub we want with the biggest grins on our faces the whole time.I want to hold your hand when you bring our child into this world. I want our friends to come over and get totally jealous because they don't share a love like we do. I want us to run outside in the rain and act like kids getting completely soaked and, when we come back in, stripping down to nothing as we stumble into the bedroom.I want it to take your breath away when I say, ""I love you,"" because you know it's coming from the heart. I want us to be sitting there and watching our child take his first steps from my arms into yours. I want us to sit down with a box of strawberries, a bottle of chocolate syrup, and a container of mint chocolate ice cream. I want to love you and be with you for at least forever, if not a little longer.I just want you to know that I had never found someone I wanted to spend the rest of my life with until I met you. I really am crazy about you, everything about you.",1
"That night our paths crossed was as if a magnetic force joined us together. It seemed as if I forgot to wake up that morning and face true reality. As our eyes connected, it seemed too fresh and real to be a dream. The fire, the strength, the longing to be loved--words were not needed as the world closed in and our eyes connected our two souls together.I remember when we first spoke, it was as if we had known each other for years. Our conversations went smoothly like changing seasons. I could not have asked the Lord for anything more assuring or hypnotizing than the soothing tone of your voice. You made my days sunny.We completed one another. You thought that no woman good enough for you existed, and then you met me. How I longed for you to know that my feelings were mutual, and that I had never met a man that could read through me and explore my inner core. Please keep in mind that I will not take your heart that I hold for granted.You are a splendid jewel. Never would I let a soul take you away or bring any harm to you. The day I looked into the blue of your eyes, I knew no force could ruin the joining of our hearts.Soul mates do exist, and now I have learned there is beauty behind all imperfections. It took us both years of hurt and pain, and it has paid off for both of us. It's true when they say, ""God makes you meet a few wrong people before you meet the right one.""Thank you for all that you have given me and still continue to give me.",1
"You once told me that I was a fool for falling for a girl like you! Well, if you feel that way, I accept it. I may be a fool, but the fact remains that I have fallen for you and I can't change that now! I want you to know that I would much rather have you in my life and take a chance on losing you than not taking that chance at all and wondering then, what it would have been like between us! What I'm trying to ask you is--would you take a chance with me? Tanya, will you be my love?I love you.",1
"""Stop looking!"" That's what everyone kept telling me. So, stop looking is what I did. And that day when I was at the mall, and you were the salesperson, you had the sweetest smile I had ever seen complemented by such beautiful eyes. My heart skipped a beat. I couldn't catch my breath, and the only thing I could really say is, ""Thanks, but I'm just looking."" I wanted to say so much more than that. I wanted to stare into your eyes and talk to your heart, but I was really nervous, so nervous that I just wanted to leave. But I stayed; you were so helpful and so genuine with the compliments you gave me.My mind worked hard thinking of clever ways to ask you out. But I was worried about rejection again. As I left, I felt no peace. I wanted to run back in and ask you to dinner. My heart was trying to pull my body back into the store, but all that kept happening was my mind kept taking over, moving one foot in front of the other, walking around the mall aimlessly, thinking about what I could say to you and asking God to give me the right words to say to you.Then a burst of confidence came over me, rehearsing the lines over and over in my head. I decided to walk back in, and I told myself, ""If she's standing all alone, that will be a sign I should go up to her."" So, as I walked past the store, there you were, standing alone, right in front of the cash register. But my mind took over again, and I marched right out of the mall and into my car.Thinking of how much of a fool I am, I started to imagine different scenarios of rejection and acceptance. As I returned to work, I was clouded with thoughts about you. So, as my confidence built up, I asked God to close all the doors, take away all the distractions, and anything else that was not from Him. And so He did.After work, I drove back to the mall, again the experience of meeting you, seeing your beautiful smile with those beautiful eyes, and your sweet voice. I hurried there and as I walked through the mall and into your store, you walked out--I knew it was a sign that you came from above.So I caught up with you, nervous as can be, and gasped, ""I know this is sudden, but would you like to go get a hamburger?"" And, with an angelic voice, you answered, ""Yes!"" My heart started to pound and butterflies fluttered in my stomach. Joy filled my heart. I wanted to dance like a child, but my feel would not move. All I could feel was my heart pounding.Thanks for the great time. Hope I can see you again soon.",1
"No one in this world knows the feeling that I get when I see you. They have no idea what I feel when I hear your name or your soft voice. Nobody has ever made me feel the way you make me feel, and that is such a crazy feeling. All I know is that I want to grab you and be in your arms forever and forever and never let go. I want to kiss your lips and never stop--just keep on going.Every time I think about you, it gives me more strength to carry on my life. It makes me happy to be alive, knowing that you've come into my life. All I know is that I want to be with you! And I hope that you, too, want always to be with me.",1
"I have known you for such a long time. This letter may come as a complete shock to you, and I apologize, but I must tell you the way I feel. Ever since the 3rd grade, I have been in love with you, and considering we are both 25 now, that's a long time.Girlfriends of mine have come and gone, but I always compared them to you, and no one could really compare. I have never known someone so beautiful, so giving, and so honest. I love being with you. I love the memories that we have shared. You're the only one who will ever hold the key to my heart. I've wanted to tell you that for so long, and I just couldn't find the right time or the right words. I love you--and that will never change.You are the most incredible woman I have ever met. You're so outgoing and so friendly--and you always have so much to say. You're so sweet, and your heart is so big. I have never met anyone with a heart like yours, and I love you for it. You're the type of girl that, when you walk into a room, all eyes fall on you, and everyone's heart brightens up. You're the type of girl that men dream of when they close their eyes at night. You're the type of girl that guys can't wait to bring home to meet mom. You're the type of girl who I dream of spending the rest of my life with.I hope some day I gain enough courage to tell you how I feel, because losing you to someone else would devastate me. I love you, always and forever.",1
"Let me see your face at least once a day. Don't take this pleasure away from me. I get anxious when you even pass by without giving me a glance! I wait the whole day just to see you. You are the view that quenches my hungry eyes. My respect for you grows each day; already it's as big as a mountain.I make no expectations of you, and I am not waiting for something in return. All I want is for you to let me see your face at least once a day!It's becoming hard to see you anymore because it inspires me so much, and I'm so very attracted towards you now. I don't want these feelings to grow anymore, but I need to ask, ""Can I see your face every hour of every day?""From,",1
"This letter is prompted by the noblest of impulses, so don't misunderstand the message it is going to convey.When I met you, as if by a God-sent blessing, I thought that I saw a light of soft understanding. What had come over me? I never felt like this before. Yes, before I met you, I lived a peaceful life. I could come and go and feel no trouble. But now, I am disturbed, both body and soul.Can it be my imagination, or is it that love has struck too deeply, and I must pay for what is asked of me? I have tried to restrain myself. I have tried to stifle my desires, knowing that I am not worthy. But love's orders are imperative. Who am I to battle the call of fate? I know that when I saw you, Cupid had marked me for his victim. Yes, it is love that has taken root in my heart.Let me console myself that I have loved you in name only, a way that lingers only in imagination, in a mere dream, in fantasy, the creation of my lonely heart. Here I am still longing for your attention. I love you!",1
"It has been a long time since we first met. I can't believe how long I've loved you, and how long I have contained my love.The look of your eyes and that smile that you gave me melted my heart away. Those smooth cheeks--oh, I wished I could have kissed you right away. As soon as I saw your face, my knees weakened, my heart throbbed, hoping I could get nearer to you.I loved the way you looked at me the other day. My mouth felt numb, and I stuttered and I couldn't talk. I wished I had the courage to, though, because you're the most beautiful angel I've ever seen. I have been waiting years for you now. I hope I'll be able to talk to you soon. I just don't have the courage to yet.Thanks for the smile you gave me. I really melted inside. I could say nothing, but just stared at your natural beauty. I wish we could go out together some day, and that we could have our nights by the beach. I would pour my feelings out to you then. Thank you for the feelings you awaken. No matter what happens, you are in my heart. I hope I'll be able to hold you in my arms and tell you that I love you. That's all I need from you. I love you--that's my promise.",1
"We have been friends for a long time now. Every day spent with you is like a wonderland of surprises. I've stood back, watched and listened as you told me of your past loves. If you only knew that there is a true love waiting for you--patiently. A hug from you makes me feel brand new. But these are words I'll never say, and so I will just sit back, patiently waiting; loving you in silence.",1
"Life is so unpredictable. Changes are always coming, big or small. I ask myself what is really special about you?It might be all the things I see on the surface, the things that everyone notices and admires about your qualities, talents, and wonderful smile so obviously connected to a warm and loving heart. These things set you apart from everyone else. And it might also be the little things--the way you walk, the way you talk, and every action. It gives me joy just to see a smile in your eyes. If I ever figure out the magic that makes you so special, I'd probably find out that it's a combination of all these things. You are a rare person. I find you really amazing!Inside me there is a place where my sweetest dreams reside, where my highest hopes are kept alive, where my deepest feelings are felt, and where my favorite memories are kept safe and warm. I find that you're on my mind more often than anything else. Sometimes I intentionally think of you just to make my day brighter. But more often, you surprise me and I find you in my thoughts. There are even times when I realize you've been a part of my dreams. Then during the day, when my imagination is free to run, it takes me into your arms and allows me to linger there, knowing there's nothing I'd rather do. I know my thoughts are reflecting the loving hopes of my heart because whenever they wander, they always take me to you.Only special things can come inside my heart and stay. And now, I realize how deeply my life has been touched by you.",1
"You are like a dream I never thought would come true for me. When I just hear your voice, I start to smile with joy. My eyes shine with joy if I even believe you are thinking about me. When you sing the song you wrote for me, it makes me feel as if we were meant to be together. You are so special. I pray we will finally know if we are meant to be with one another. I haven't even talked to anyone like you before. You make me feel special like no one has before. The things you do show me that you are such a caring person and will love me till the end of time. I just want to be loved and have someone love me in return, the way I've always wanted. I want to find my best friend, my soul mate, my lover, and my Prince Charming. I feel as if you may just be the one I am looking for and have been searching for all my life. These are the kind of feelings I have for you now.",1
"Hey, Baby, I know we haven't been dating very long, but I want you to know that I love you from the bottom of my heart. From the moment I first met you, I knew that I wanted you in my life, whether as just a friend or something more. Baby, I prayed for a long time to find someone like you--someone willing to fight alongside me, someone to make me smile and someone who would truly love me. You're in my thoughts, my dreams, and every breath I take.I know that this is true love. I feel like I can tell you anything. You know things about me that even my best friend doesn't know now. You're always there to pick me up when I fall and to dry my tears. Thank you, Baby. I love you.",1
"I never thought I could really love someone as much as I love you. We started out as friends, just talking, but over the last couple of months I've truly fallen for you, head over heels. You're not one who can admit how you feel, but I believe somewhere in your heart you have feelings for me, too. I know you would not have just wasted your time for nothing. You know I care. You're the only person who could ever put joy in my heart and a smile on my face.I don't want you to leave me. I told you, I'd wait for you if you got sent away and that's the truth. You said if that ever happened to me, you would wait for me, too. I hope that's the truth, too. I will always love you. I can't see myself with any other guy but you. That's the truth. I'm in love with you.",1
"Hi, Sweetie! I didn't have the courage to approach you in person, so I hope you will consider the words written in this letter. I have so much inside my heart that it speeds my breathing sometimes. I know we just met, but these feelings I have for you keep glowing and growing every day. Now that I have met you, I go to sleep thinking about you, and the next morning I wake up smiling because I may see you.It's amazing how you got me and won me. I never thought I could love this much, but I was so wrong. I just thank God for having found you. We were meant for each other, and no one can change that. I love you with ALL my heart.",1
"The best thing that happened in my life was the day we first met. You captured my heart with your sweet smile, your tantalizing eyes, and you kissable lips. As time passed by, we became closer, not just as friends, but more than that.You gave me your heart, I gave you all my love, and now our world goes up and down. We faced many trials and circumstances, but we surpassed them all. Now, however, things are pretty black. I don't know went wrong. Do you?Now it's time for me to say goodbye. It's not because I don't love you anymore, but just to give you time and space to think about what you want to do, but always remember that I will still love you.",1
"RE: Describing True FeelingsI am writing you this letter to tell you how much you mean to me, and to thank you for coming into my life. You are something I never thought could exist for me. You are the best thing that has ever happened in my life, and I don't regret telling you how I feel.I have been through many relationships, but didn't really take any of them seriously. I was used and abused by a guy who I really loved once. So I decided to play guys the same way that guy had played me. I wasn't born nasty; a guy made me this way. Since then I have not taken chances with a guy again. But you happened; you came into my life and stole my heart away from the day I met you.At first I was confused. I didn't really know what I wanted. I didn't know if I wanted to take a chance again and actually take you seriously. So, I decided to come close to you as a friend and find out who you truly were first and what you were really like. You seemed cool, nice, and funny--some things I really liked in a guy. So I took a chance and got together with you.In the beginning, things didn't seem to go very well. I actually had my doubts about you, and I wasn't sure you were actually taking me seriously. But it was too late to turn back. I had already fallen for you from the day I first met you, and I wasn't really looking forward to giving up so soon. I tried so hard to know you. I wasn't going to let you go so easily!Well, time has passed, and I have discovered new things about a new me. You have truly changed me. Still, in a way, I'm scared, because I'm growing a deep feeling inside my heart that I just can't explain, but I know it's there waiting for you to come and uncover it. I truly don't know what your feelings are, but I don't want to force you to tell me something you don't really feel towards me. I want to receive love and trust from you when you truly mean it. All I ask of you is to show me you care and not to hide anything, and to also trust me the way I trust you.",1
"This is the final letter I'll ever send you. I never knew love until I met you. You came into my life through a dating site on the Internet, and I'll never forget that night we met in the chat room. We shared our hopes and dreams for the future. I just pray when you read this letter, it touches your heart and restarts what we had before. I love you and want to be with you. I want so much for us to have the best life together.If only you knew how your absence has affected me. You gave so much hope that we could have a relationship and now you have taken that hope away. To cut me out of your life in such a manner is cruel. How could you have changed so much unless what you said in the beginning was not true?",1
"I remember the exact moment I fell in love with you. At that moment, I realized how perfect you were and how much you meant to me. Not long before that, I had my heart broken and I told myself that I would never fall in love again. Now it seems that I love you but you do not feel the same toward me and you want to end our relationship. I wonder how you can be sure that this does not work for you.I would like to have another chance. If I never get another chance, I want to thank you for allowing me to share some great times.",1
"I don't even know what to say. There are many things that swim through my mind. I don't think you realize how much I love you. I would do anything for you. I've put off my friends and my family to be with you. Whenever you've needed me to do anything, I've done it which might be some of the problem. I think you expect everything from me now, but you don't really appreciate it.The conversations we've had about our friendship and where it's at and where it's going are so confusing to me. At one point, you told me how important I was to you. Then you tell me that you don't see how you could ever love me. The truth is that I never asked you to love me. I'm content loving you and just having you there as my friend. I hate the thought of not having you around anymore.Maybe someday you'll appreciate me but right now I have to concentrate on me and hope that someday I will find someone to love me for a change.",1
"I love you very much but you tell me that I should not because you are not ready to fall in love. You say you are afraid of being hurt. You should know that not every time you fall in love you will get hurt. You should take a little time and think of the good things that can come of it, instead of only thinking about what could go wrong. I believe that we have been very supportive of one another and that some good things happen between us. Can you learn to appreciate me and realize how good we can be together?",1
"I feel like you are pulling away from this relationship. There are times when you tell me that you love me, but I do not feel like you love me as a man is supposed to love his wife. You tell me this is so unnecessary, but you need to realize it is necessary to me. I am living on our love and when it feels like it is one-sided, that hurts more than you realize.You also do things that confuse me especially in how you treat our children. You don't seem to try to be understanding; they are growing up and you seem afraid to lose them. But children do grow up and leave home and there is nothing to fear. They will always be our kids; we will always care for them and they know that.When our children are on their own, we will have more time together. That time can be great for us and especially for rekindling the passion that we once had. You have told me this many times and now you seem to have forgotten and are upset that we will have an empty nest. We are going to be happy and I will do all that I can to make this come true.",1
"I want to thank you for all the love, happiness, pain, and tears you have brought into my life. I always told you that you came into my life for a reason. And yes, it is true, you have taught me to love unconditionally, no matter how painful it was. I will always remember the love we shared, and the thought of it will always bring me a smile with no regrets, even though it brought me both joy and tears.You have strengthened my faith and brought me closer to God, as I always depended on Him because I was always afraid to lose you. I never really lost you, did I? I know you loved me--not enough to hold on to me but enough to love me for a short time. Although I was not able to behave properly with you, I am more cautious now and wiser.You hurt me; I can still feel the pain of every word you told me, especially when you weren't sure if you loved me or not. I used to ask myself, how could this guy who had once put sweet, loving messages on my answering system hurt me now so badly with his hurtful words. I loved you so much that when you pushed me away, I lost my self-esteem, my self-confidence, even my ability to think, so I realize what I felt for you was true love. You actually made me stronger when you hurt me this way. I did not say it was good for me to be hurt, but it was only because we shared true love that I could be so badly hurt.It is silly, but the tears you brought me cleansed my heart from all past hurt. I probably still might not be over what I've suffered in the past, but this experience made me a better person. I still cry when I think about you. I still have sleepless nights, still wake up too early, thinking of you. I still wish we could be together. I still wish you loved me, but I am a better person now, able to understand things better, not just from my point of view. I can better understand other people's emotions now, so I don't see how I could ever hate you. Thanks for bringing out the best in me, for all the joy, for giving me the best thing that ever happened in my life--YOU. I know it's not the end for me. I shouldn't be ever afraid to love again; I only need to be wiser.In my heart, you will always be more than just a sweet memory of the past or the love that once was, much more than that. I only walked away because you asked me too, because you thought it would make you happy, but my heart is never letting you go. There will always be a place in my heart for you, even though you have given up on us.I guess I will always love you. I will always love that simple man, the sweet you, the sensitive you, the affectionate you. And I will always miss your loving messages, your admiring glances, the sweet kisses, your strong arms, the feeling of being safe around you, your sweet smile, our long telephone conversations, and our late night dinners.I will always turn around when I see the same color van you drove, or see your letters in a license plate and stop, smile and think of you. I will always look back on the places we've been with that special joy in my heart. The time we spent was brief, but I loved every minute of it, and I will always cherish it.I thank God you came into my life and I love you and always will.",1
"Some days you feel so far away, and that's when I feel the most confused; I feel as though we aren't even together. Though you've talked about forever and you say you love me, what do those words really mean to you? To me there is no definition, no meaning that has any value, and I wonder if you are being true. Can I really rely on you? Though you've hurt me many times before, I've always found it in my heart to forgive--forgive the pain and see through the tears. So, I wonder what is the true meaning of our love, or is there really any meaning left? I can't help but ask myself the same questions time and time again.So where does the line between love and hate fall in this relationship? Where is the space between the good and the bad, the truth and the lies? Sometimes I just want to give up on us. But how can I give up on you, when you still have my heart in chains, when you still have your arms around me, around my soul? I want to leave, but I still love you. Sometimes I think I will always love you, and that makes me cry.",1
"Every day we are apart, the memories fade, but the pain grows, which is exactly the opposite of what the effect of time is supposed to be. Is this the result of losing my first love? If so, I wonder how you are feeling. Are you wondering as I am if we should try again? Or do you truly want to say goodbye forever?Neither one of us can deny that we once cared nor that we enjoyed being intimate. There were many times when we said ""love you"" at exactly the same moment. I had hoped for a love that would last forever, but that was not to be.I am glad that you were my first love and I hold onto the dream that we may get back together again or go forward and each find a true love.",1
"I am very sorry we can't be together. I am writing to let you know how much I love you and miss you. I will be leaving here soon, and I don't know when I will ever see you again. Before I leave, I wanted to let you know how much I love and care about you.Wherever I am, I will always love you, no matter what happens. I just wanted to say goodbye, I love you. I always have and always will.",1
"It's been a long time since you've heard from me. Although we see each other every day, I can say that things are different now. The atmosphere is cold, as if we don't have something in common anymore. It's been so hard for me to accept that we're living separate lives now, looking at things as if we're strangers. The pain that you brought me is not easy to forget. Every day I'm hurting, but trying to survive.Sometimes it's easier because I didn't think about you all day, or maybe I did, but chose to ignore the thoughts. Little by little, I'm beginning to learn how to love myself and not think about you. Sometimes I still feel emotion and think about the past and the good memories we had, even if I knew that it would make me feel worse.My environment, especially in the office, has not been helpful for me at all. It's painful to see you, day in and day out. Sometimes I want to quit and start a new life far away from you, but it's hard. Just the thought of not being able to see you makes me weak. I know it's not healthy, but it's my way of trying to be happy.Every day, I'm waiting for signs, which usually leaves me with hopeless expectations. Every move and every action you make, I interpret. I'm like a fool watching you every moment and so desperate for you to notice my existence. A simple smile makes me happy. A short conversation makes my whole day brighter. I need you to ease my aching heart, and it doesn't take much to keep me going.I'm still not over you. Even if I repeat 1000 times that I am over you, I know deep in my heart that I'm not. I'm still waiting and wanting to be with you again. I still want you back!",1
"I don't believe our relationship can survive another break up. It seems that we constantly go back and forth, and so many suggestions and promises stay lingering over our heads.You've got your life all sorted out, except for this relationship and, by the sound of it, you're miserable. Why are you here? Why do you insist on staying together if you're not happy?I told you once upon a time that I was only on the backburner of your life, and here we are months later, and I'm still back there. Perhaps it's the difference in age. You said last night it was. We want different things--we're at different stages in life.It's not even the marriage issue any longer. I suppressed that subject in my mind and in my heart a while back. This time I'm looking into the future, and I can't picture us being happy. I cannot see where you will place me as a priority in your life. I don't see marriage, I don't see kids. I don't see you having any interest in being my partner for life. Can you give this relationship the attention it so desperately deserves or not?I'm not sure I can go on anymore the way things have been. I will let you go if I have to and move on.",1
"Every day, every moment that goes by I think of you. My brain tells me to give up, but my heart says I can't stop loving you. I spend all day dreaming of the moment you would call to say you feel the same way. As much as I try to pretend, the truth is, I can't stop loving you. I don't know how to stop.I will cherish the moments we have spent together, from our very first kiss to our last. I miss the way you kissed me, the way you looked at me and rubbed my face. I miss you calling me ""Ms. Maynard"" (because you know it gets on my nerves). I miss you missing me, I miss everything about you. I miss our phone conversations, and the way we would spend hours talking about our native countries, and the different ways we grew up. But most of all, I miss my best friend.I will place the moments we've shared together in a time capsule and hide it in the most secret place of my heart. And maybe 20 years from now, if or when we meet again, maybe then we can both open the capsule together and be reminded of our wonderful friendship.Gosh, my life is miserable! I finally met the right guy (you), but he's not available. I'm in love with you, but we can't be together. I've got to tell you, though, for the first time in months, I can finally smile because, although you didn't say much the last time you called, I could tell you still cared.You can keep on denying it, you can keep hiding from it, but you are only lying to yourself. Every day I ask myself, ""Why, why do I feel this way? Why can't I stop loving you?"" Then it dawned on me--you've put a spell on me! Just kidding.Before I go, I want you to know that you will always have a special place in my heart and, like I've said many times before, I do not regret anything we've done. The only thing I regret is you telling me you love me, because since then you have given me nothing but the cold shoulder.Please don't be scared, I want nothing but your friendship, well--I do want more, but I am willing to settle for less. I am not trying to make you feel bad or push you further away. I am just trying to make you understand what's in my heart.I love you with all my heart, and I will always love you.",1
"Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I still love you with all my heart. I don't know what I'll do without you in my life.Even though I try to spend time with other people, you just can't be replaced. I'm so hurt that you've given up on us. I know in other people's eyes we weren't the best couple, but in my eyes we were.I miss everything about you, and I can never get you off my mind, no matter how hard I try. People keep on telling me to just let you go, but it's easier said than done. I just can't let you go. And every time I try, it never seems to work out as I plan.Every day I pray that you will come back to me, telling me you love me and you'll never leave me again. You will always and forever be my baby, my heart, my soul, my friend. I just thought I should let you know that I'll never forget you.",1
"It's been a long time since we've talked, and I miss you. I miss that summer and everything we had. I know I acted silly when we were going out, but maybe you did a little, too. If I could turn back time, I would make things better. I heard people say some things, and I let them influence me. I wasn't mature enough to talk things out with you. Instead, I acted like a little girl by ignoring you when you tried to talk to me. I'm sorry for hurting you. Now I want you back in my life because I need a friend like you again.I don't know how you feel. I know my feelings for you are still the same, and my memories haven't faded.Now I realize that you don't ever know what you've got till you lose it. I lost you and I regret it. This is how I feel, and I miss you. Can we talk again? I would like to.",1
"Every morning, I wake up realizing what I did, and nothing in the world can make it go away. I'm sorry for leaving the second time, and I regret that decision. When we met each other at the Liberty Diner and I saw your face, your eyes glistened with the same sparkle that mine had when I first saw you. I felt driven. That feeling has never left and will never leave.I remember waking up to next to you, watching you as you slept, watching the way you walked to your car, the way you answered the phone, the way your lips curled when you said ""I love you,"" the way you blew in my face when I took your breath away and, most importantly, the way you showed me how to love you. Those are the few things I miss, and I would give anything in the world to have all that back again. But my mistake cost me happiness and the love I'll never find again. It hurts me day in and day out to think about it. And what hurts the worst is knowing that I hurt someone who was in love with me.I am still so much in love with you. My leaving left me with a lot of pain, the kind of pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone. I'm not good at writing letters, as you know, but this is how I feel.I love you so much. I cry every night thinking about you.",1
"The pain you have caused me is unbearable. I cannot sleep, I no longer eat. I wish things could be as they were in the beginning, but now I realize that is impossible. I have insulted your intelligence and criticized your looks. That is a dumb thing to do and I wish that I had not.All I can ask for now is your forgiveness although I yearn for so much more. If I could undo what I had done, I would. I regret those negative comments. I apologize for my behavior and hope that you agree to a new beginning.Maybe one day, our paths will cross again. I wish for that and if this wish is granted, everything will be different. I will treat you how you deserve to be treated, and I vow I will never cause you any harm or pain.",1
"If only we could travel back in time, I would do all the things that I did not do last time. I would be good, not throwing tantrums anymore, cherishing you for who you are, and I would try to be the best love of your life. When I think back on those days we had, it pains me again and again, for I can't imagine how I could have made such terrible mistakes that caused me such a high price--losing you.Regrets and remorse are what I feel. Even now, a year after we parted, I still care about you and love you, no matter what. We have formed memories for each other that no one else could ever replace. At least we've carved special memories in each other's hearts in which we were the other's first love.If we could travel back in time, I would seek for every opportunity to hold on to you and not lose you. I would follow you no matter where you went, I would swim the deepest ocean, climb the highest mountain. I love you.",1
"If only I could find the courage to give you this letter. I never knew love until I knew you. We shared our minds, bodies, hearts, and souls with each other. We shared a feeling so deep that it simply couldn't be put into words, but I never knew loving someone could hurt this bad. We have hurt each other in ways we promised we never would, too.The love in my heart for you will never change. People say that time heals all wounds. But the truth is, I still dream of you, I still cry myself to sleep thinking of you, and I still wish on every star that you were here with me. I hope and pray every day that I will run into you. I still look out the window, hoping you will pull into the driveway. First thing I do when I come home is check the answering machine. I still love you and want you to have the best in life.What hurt me the most is the day that should have been one of the biggest in our lives: the day our daughter was born. I was scared, I needed you. I always thought in my heart that you would be there for that special moment, no matter what was going on. As I lay on that hospital bed, having your baby, I thought you would show up. I prayed so hard that you would come, but you didn't. You didn't even call to see if our newborn child was okay. I have never felt so scared, lost, and alone as I did that day. I wish I knew why, I wish I could understand. If you ever need me, though, I'll still be there. You have a special place in my heart and, no matter what, you'll always be there.I hope one day you will come around and get to know and love our daughter. She is one gift from our love you gave me that you can never take back.",1
"Thank you for coming into my life. The day I wanted to end my life because he left me, you came to tell me that life must go on. You were sent to be my angel. Thank you for everything, for all your sacrifices.I miss those times when you called me ""Honey Bunch."" When I was exhausted at the end of the day and called you, you were always there to listen to my troubles. You have been my inspiration; you helped me achieve my dreams. But now, they've all fallen apart.I know I'm not the kind of woman you dreamed of, I don't have the perfect body, but still you loved me for who I am. I remember you once told me, ""It doesn't matter if you can't love me too."" If you only knew, Baby, you were my life, my friend. If you only knew how happy I was to have you, and how my life fell apart when I lost you.I know that I've hurt you so many times and that I shouldn't be bothering you now. I know that I said, ""Let me go,"" but still here I am asking for another chance. Things really changed when you left. My life started to lose direction. I must admit, I can't move on now.I kept on blaming myself because it was my entire fault. I've been too selfish, too hard on you. Now I'm starting to realize that you were too good for me. You are a very good man, and you deserve someone better than I am. I tried to change for you, but my efforts were not enough. I hope somehow that I made your life special, anyway, though I've not been perfect for you. I hope you'll be happy now and that you can find the person whom you truly deserve.If you really decide to let go, then there's nothing I can do. I know ""sorry' is not enough for the things I have done, but I hope my sincerity is enough. I regret the foolish things that I have done. Because of those things, I lost you, I lost my life. And I'll never love again because of that. But if you can give me another chance, I swear this time I'll make sure I won't hurt you and never, ever let you go.Even if it will take me a lifetime, I will wait for you to come back. I would not want another love. I'd rather be alone than be with someone who could never take your place.We've done our best to make our relationship last longer, but things happened and we had to say ""goodbye."" This goodbye would not mean forgetting our memories; they are too special to forget. It does not mean forgetting the things in our past that made us both better individuals. Maybe we had to say ""goodbye,"" but I want you to remember this--you will always have a special place in my heart. I consider myself lucky to have experienced a love as wonderful as ours. For the last time, I love you.",1
"Hi, how are you? Things on my end are going--well, let's just say that I am alive. I have never been the type to express exactly how I feel, but there are a few things that I would like to tell you. Every morning I wake up and there is a pain that shoots through my heart. The thought that I have to spend another day without you rips my soul apart.I know we thought it would be better for us both if we ended it, but the time I have spent away from you has taught me that I am inseparably a part of you, and you are a part of me, and that the best place for both of us is with each other. It pains me to know that you wake up with another woman beside you. It pains me to know that I could have let the best thing that ever happened to me leave without a fight. What hurts the most is the thought that you might not feel the same. I can't see my future any other way, except with you in it. It scares me to think, though, that you can so easily envision your future without me in it.",1
"It's been a long time since we've spoken or even seen each other. When we were together, it felt so right. I miss the way you would hold me. I wish you knew how much you meant to me. I know this is all my fault and I wish I could take everything back. I think about you all the time. You're always on my mind. You were the best thing that ever happened to me. I pray that one day we will meet again and things will be like they used to be. It was only when I was with you that I felt special and felt the love that words can't describe. I will always love you and you will always have a special place in my heart.",1
"I notice how, when I'm around you, you aren't your usual cheery self anymore. I don't think you need a person like me in your life right now. You really need to worry about the future, and it doesn't look like I'll be a part of it, and I just bring you down.I still think our relationship can work if we both want it. I care for you very much.Let's have a break. I'll call you next week.",1
"Where do I start? I wish I could tell you how much I still love you with all my heart. You're thousands of miles away, but I would walk there this instant just to see your smile.You were my great love at one point in my life. You would think that I'd be over you by now, but I'm not. I never told you how much I loved being with you. I became all yours. They say if you let something go, and it comes back to you, it's meant to be. You came back to me once, but then you left me again. I still love you, Baby, and I hope you're doing okay wherever you are. Let's call one another.",1
"Never did I imagine that, at my young age, I could fall in love. I always believed love to be something built out of maturity and respect.Words can never express the way I feel, but I'd like to try. First of all, you made my heart beat faster with every touch. I loved holding you, kissing you, just being with you. You were everything I wanted and admired. If I had one wish, it would be to feel the thrill of knowing that out of all the people in the world, you could choose me. I was the one you needed; your best friend and you were mine. And now we are apart and I am lost without you.I pray every night for you to come back. Every time I think of you, I decide: ""Okay, think of the last happy memory when you were together; then move on."" I never can.You are all I think about, and I simply cannot imagine life without you. I would like to be in your life again if you feel that our relationship could work. Let's meet and make and talk about this.",1
"It has been such a long time since we became friends. We have shared so many good things together. I laughed and cried with you, shared some sparkling moments with you. But there is something that you didn't know. I love you. Not just as a friend, but as someone who wants to share a lifetime with you.It doesn't matter if you don't love me, as long as I can love you. I have always asked myself why I love you, but I cannot answer. I won't let this love ruin our friendship, a friendship that we have shared for the past two years.I only wish that if the time comes when you will find out how much I love you, you won't hate me. For if you do, I don't know what will happen to me. Just remember one thing, though I will always love you.",1
"I get sad when I look back on our time together. I withdraw into those moments we had that were so consumed with passion and so full of promise. If I could go back and relive each of those precious moments with you, I would certainly do it even if I knew the pain I would face when the time came to walk away.My feelings for you were feelings of love, unlike anything I have ever known. I wonder if I will feel that strongly again. I've also had to accept the fact that what I felt was one-sided. I loved you and I have no regrets about that. You were always very honest with me. Never once did you lead me on. You always made me face reality and deal with life. How do I say ""thank you"" for something like that? I know we were never actually together, but the memories I have of you are treasures.",1
"After the first couple of times we went out, I knew I was in love with you and wanted to be with you for the rest of my life. Being with you brings great joy because I'm so in love with you.I promise you this: I will never cheat, lie, or do anything to hurt you. I seriously want a strong relationship that will head towards starting a family. Having a child with you would bring another person into our lives that we can love. The thought of having a child that looks like you and a little like me gives me goose bumps.I will love you always and forever. But please let us talk about our future.",1
"I know I said I was over you, but I miss you every day. I miss the things we used to do, and the relationship we used to have. I thank you for caring for me in your own special way and loving me through all these years.I wonder each day if we can ever rekindle that love we once shared, because it hurts when I think of you with someone else.Do you remember our song? I listen to it every day and it has many memories including when we first danced to it. I know we made mistakes, but I still love you, and hope I can get you back in my life.",1
"The pain you have caused me is unbearable. I cannot sleep, I no longer eat; even breathing is difficult now. I wish things could be as they were in the beginning, but now I realize that is impossible. I have done nothing but insulted your intelligence and questioned your beauty, which I assure you is unlike anything I have ever witnessed. Your eyes shine with an amazing radiance, your smile is divine, and your image remains cemented in my mind. It is ironic, because you were my one and only true happiness, though at times you were my only sorrow.All I can ask for now is your forgiveness, though inside I yearn for so much more. I yearn for your gentle touch, to gaze into your mystifying eyes again, and to kiss your full red lips just one more time. If I had known things would have turned out this way, I would have done things differently. All of my immature insults would have been compliments instead.I can do nothing but apologize for my behavior. These feelings of love are so new to me. I have never felt for anyone what I feel for you. I have pushed you away, and spoiled my opportunity if, in fact, a chance ever existed. Maybe one day, our paths will cross again. If this wish is granted, all will be different. I will treat you how you deserve, and I vow I will never cause you any harm. Until then, I shall suffer the punishment I have dealt myself.",1
"It's been years since the last time I saw your face. I have seen many beautiful moons and sunsets, but no trace of your smile. My heart has longed for you, as the flowers long for rain. What have you been doing all this time? I hope you remember the way I used to call your name back then, when we were seeing each other. There are so many things that I can't forget about you. How your hair glistens in the sunlight, the way you speak, the way you walk--I love everything about you. I wish I could be where you are right now. To hold you and tell you the very secret that my soul has kept inside up till now--that I love you. My purpose in life is to protect you and find everything you want and need. As I write this letter, I can almost feel you near me.Last night, in my dreams, I saw your face. You are so beautiful. You were standing at the beach and the wind was blowing through your hair. Then I started to reach you but as soon as I was getting nearer to you, you faded away, and I couldn't do anything about it. I started to bow my head and began crying, but then I heard your voice calling me. As you faded away, I found myself remembering everything about those beautiful moments I did spend with you.I always dream of you this way. The days pass by, but my love never passes, it just grows stronger in the depths of my heart. Please don't ask me why I still long for you. My heart will always belong to you. You are my heart, my life, my world. You are my one and only love.",1
"Although you may never read this letter, I just want you to know that I never stopped loving you. Although our time together was short and ended mutually, my feelings haven't changed, and I still love you with all my heart. I know it is too late now to think you will ever come back to me. We had our rough times, and sometimes we didn't come out as strong as I would have liked, but even with the way things turned out, I still love you, and probably always will. I deeply regret the day I wrote the letter that ended our relationship. I love you.",1
"It's been about two months since I last talked to you. That conversation did not end well. We both seemed hurt and confused. You said that you did not want to be in any relationship with as many arguments as we had. I agree with you but I do not think that I am the only one to blame. I know that I was often responsible, but can you take some responsibility for the misunderstandings? We agree that we both care for one another but do you believe that we can both change enough to make this work?My heart aches and it seems to still care about you so I am going to call soon.",1
"It's been nine months now since we called an end to our relationship and still you occupy my thoughts. At night, I toss and turn, trying so hard to forget you, then fall asleep and find you still there, haunting me in my dreams. I remember a time when I could not wait to go to bed and think about our times together. Now those sweet memories are nightmares which torment me.I wish that I knew the words that I could have said that would have kept you with me. If I could find them now, would it be too late? Have you moved on so quickly? I know time has passed, but for me it seems only yesterday that we were laughing and planning our lives together. I know you were scared, but so was I. You are probably scared still; I know I am. I wish I had you to comfort me. I wish I could also comfort you.There are so many things I wish I hadn't done and so many things I wish I had done. I wish I knew the words to tell you how I feel. I'm certain there is something I should have said. If I had found the words, I could be holding you instead of writing a letter.My mother always told me, ""If you find the one you think you're supposed to be with, don't let him get away. If you do, you'll regret it for the rest of your life."" I already regret. I loved you so much and still do. It wouldn't have mattered what we had to struggle through, we could have made it. Wouldn't the struggle have been better than separation? My heart tells me that it would have and I want to try.I miss you so much, Honey Bear. Please think about our getting together.",1
"It is really hard to begin to describe the way I feel about you. I have told you for over a year now, and we are still not together. You tell me that you don't feel the same way. No, let me take that back, you tell everyone else you don't feel the same way (you don't love me). If you are afraid of hurting me, then not saying anything to me face-to-face hurts me more than anything. No matter what, I can't seem to stop thinking about you or believing we were meant to be together. I guess that's how love goes. You must struggle at the beginning to find true happiness in the end.Maybe I've tried too hard or have gone the wrong way. I don't know why we aren't together, but I do know my feelings are real. There certainly isn't real communication between us. I definitely am not myself around you, so you really haven't gotten to know the real me.If only we could start over and forget that I have feelings for you, we could get to know each other better. So, am I a hopeless romantic? Then you are a man of pain and anger. I guess I believe there is a prince inside every man, including the beast. No matter what, you will never make me feel sorry for loving you. I don't know if I have made any sense at all, but I'll end this letter now. I have waited a year now to go out with you, but I'll wait forever to be with you.",1
"We were together so many years and although we have traveled different roads, our hearts remain joined. You were and will always be my soul mate. I wish we had both expressed our feelings way back then, but neither of us really knew what we wanted at the time.Our paths cross from time to time and when I see you, I wish we were still together. Whatever the future may bring, please remember I will forever be waiting for you on the sidelines. I love you and always will.",1
"My mistake was letting you go. I do so because I believed that needed something more than what I already had. I now know that I was trying to find a love that I already had with you. My mistake was thinking something was wrong when really we were experiencing only life changes. My heart did not change.I now realize that we have missed many months when we should have been together. And the fault is mine because I was the one that set this problem in motion. I know that I will have to be the one who works out a solution, if you will let me.I hope that you will agree to try to save our relationship.",1
"It has been a long time since we really had a talk. Each time we meet, it's either filled with animosity or silence. I know I am the one who has caused things to be like they are today, but how could you have changed into someone that I can't recognize at all? You were never just another person to me. Of all the people I have met, you were the only one for me, the only one that I wanted to spend my life with. I know I threw everything away by not cherishing you, and I know I don't deserve to ask you to come back now, after all that I have done. I am too ashamed of myself to even face up to everything that I've done.My promise to you is that I will wait for the day when all the bad memories are erased, when we can truly start anew and carry on our lives together again. This is the vision I have of the future, and the only thing that I look forward to now; to walk with you by my side again.",1
"If only you knew how much your absence has pained me. I no longer have that safe place to go to, that special place that was you, safe and secure, and so full of love. I have never experienced such terrible pain which comes from knowing I'll never get to see or hear from you again as my love.To have given me so much, to have made so many promises, telling me that I could put all my trust in you and that you'd never let me down, then to cut me out of your life in such a manner was cruel. But you decided my fate. By coming into my life, giving me something wonderful and making me believe in you, only to take it all away has sentenced me to a life of emptiness. I don't think I can ever trust anyone with my love again. I'll never know what it's like to be intimate with someone again.You moved out leaving me behind with nothing but memories. This pain is my lifetime sentence for loving you.But I refuse to be bitter. So I wish you a good and happy life and hope that we can someday get back into touch as friends.",1
"I met you when I was at a very low point in my life. You were like a shooting star--so bright and so beautiful. You brought light where there was only darkness, hope where there was despair, love where there was emptiness, and passion where there was indifference. You made everything new, bright and shiny.Every day became a special adventure. Your kisses left me breathless. When your arms were wrapped around me, I didn't want anything else. I never felt so loved and so safe. And then, as quickly as you appeared, you were gone. It seems my love was not enough to hold you. I thought we would last forever. I guess I was wrong. I miss you.",1
"Never did I think it was possible for one person to hurt another so badly. I never wanted this for us. I know we could have been great together. I know that I would have stayed with you for the rest of our lives. I gave you chance after chance, but you threw every one out the window. I wanted nothing but the best for you. I loved you so much.I remember in the beginning how you treated me like a queen. That changed as you became more critical and hurtful. You once were everything to me and now we can't be together without my feeling hurt. It's not that I don't want you; it's because I can not be with you if you do not change your behavior.I want you to know, though, that I will always remember you as the one who taught me how to love with my whole being. I know this will be hard on you now. It's hard on me too. I hope one day you'll understand why I have to do this. If you agree to get help, call me.",1
"You taught me that I was special and that I deserved all the world could give. You said that I was truly an angel, and that there are people out there worthy of my love. I wanted your love and you said that you did love me.Then you taught me that love doesn't last forever and that those you love can lie. And you left me. I sometimes wonder if I can stop loving you. The answer is that I can and that I will never again let anyone hurt me as you have. The feelings that I have for you seem still to be feelings of love. Perhaps they are, but they may also be feelings of sadness about what I had hoped we could be together.",1
"The strong desire that you had for me seems gone. I feel like you do not need me that way anymore; that you just want a family with no strings attached. And it seems that you no longer want or need intimacy which is so important in our marriage. We had many moments earlier in our marriage where we definitely had the need to share ourselves and I miss that intimacy. There does not seem to be enough loving. Have you lost all physical desire for me? I hope not.If there is something that I can do to rekindle our love, please help me to understand. As I have said many times, I am willing to listen to your needs. All that I ask is that you tell me what you need and that you listen to my needs as well.",1
"Can't you see that everything I do, I'm doing because I have to? When I tell you that I don't want to be with you, I say it only because I have to. When you ask me if I love you and I say ""no,"" it is because I have to. I tell you that we can only be friends; I say it because I have to.I have loved and been hurt too many times, so I promised myself not to get hurt again. I have given up on love because it gave up on me. So, if I were you, I would just turn around and leave. I am sure you will find someone who won't hurt you.Do you want to know what the saddest part is? I'd rather live with the pain of never knowing what could have been than risk my heart ever again. I am sorry.",1
"Words can't begin to explain how much you meant to me. You were by my side through thick and thin. You taught me how to see the world through someone else's eyes. You helped me discover who I really was, and who I want to be. You filled my heart with so much joy, but then something went wrong. You took it all away in the blink of an eye. It was only when you started to fade away that I began to see who you really were.Now I think of all the memories we've shared, and I want to thank you. Thanks for all the good advice you gave me, like: ""Reach for the highest star. Follow your dreams and you'll get what you want. Don't let the scoffers bring you down."" Thank you so much! You left emptiness in my heart when you walked out the door, but I still wish you all the best.",1
"I'm wondering how it came to this. I can't help but think about all the good times we once had together. You were there with me through it all, but now you're gone. I don't really understand why you chose to do what you did, knowing how much I loved you at one point.I was always there for you, no matter what, and even after you cheated on me and broke my heart, I still tried to make it work but that was foolish. I finally have the strength to move on. I always thought it took a very strong person to hold on, but I finally realized it takes an even stronger person to let go. So, I guess today I have to be that stronger person.",1
"I was told that time heals all wounds and time just makes things a little easier to bear. But the truth is that I still cry myself to sleep thinking of you, I still dream of you. I get dressed every day and put my makeup on in case we see each other. I still look out the window, hoping you will drive up to the house. There are times, too, when I believe I must be crazy to want you back. You were not there for me many times.You have hurt me in countless ways, in ways you promised you never would.What has hurt me more than I ever had warning for was the night I called you from the accident scene. I was scared and I needed you. For a countless number of times, I was there when you needed me and it seemed fair that you would be there for me, too. As I waited on that hospital bed, I thought you would show up. But you didn't. You didn't even call for days. I have never felt so scared, lost, and alone as I did that night. I wish I knew why, I wish I could understand why you didn't come.Strange as it seems even to me, I still care for you. I do know, however, that I have to let go and that is what I am doing.",1
"Today my life has been changed in a way I cannot yet accept. I have so many questions running through my mind. Please consider my delicate heart. I am as a child made out of glass and to lose you would shatter me.How is it that so much time spent loving and caring for someone can suddenly crumble into nothing? How can words of tender endearment suddenly be turned to comments of blind hatred and revenge? Why is change such a feared entity? Where is it we go when we step outside the comfort of familiarity? How do we recreate joy when so much emotion is trapped beneath the rubble of failure? Where do we find the know-how to pick up all the delicate shards that reflect the beauty of true love?Is there a cloth gentle enough to wipe away the blood of our bleeding hearts? How can we absorb the surrounding happiness of our friends, when our close friendship has been sapped of any remainder of happiness? How can true love end? The transition between love and friendship is a blurry path. Please remember you have been in my place once before.",1
"It has been about a year and a half since seeing, hearing, and feeling you next to me. I hope you know that you are still all that is important in my life. Though you made the decision to stop acknowledging my existence in your life, I can never escape the pain and sorrow of the void you have left in my heart and soul. With each passing day, every time I remember to breathe, I die a little more.On the day you asked me to let you go, you didn't know I had planned a new beginning for us. I had planned it all out perfectly--buying the ring that I could afford at the time--and finishing what I should have done a long time ago by finalizing the steps I needed to start our new future. I had gone to court the previous day and turned in all the paper work necessary to begin our new life together. But you asked me to let you go instead.As time went by, I started getting used to living alone, but I never gave up hope that you would come back, yet all this time has passed, and I have come to the reality that I would never see you again. The ring I bought, the life I planned, and the happiness I had dreamed of are all imaginary images now that will continue to torture me as time goes by. If only you knew who I really was, how much I loved you, and the proposal I had planned to make to you that very day.",1
"I don't know how to begin this letter; I have such deep feeling in my heart. I never thought this would happen, never thought that it could be over, and that we would say our last goodbye.I want you to know that you will always be in my heart. The times we spent together I will carry forever, deep in my soul, in the hopes that one day we will meet again and still feel this incredible, everlasting love for each other.The choices I have to make are hard and this decision is one that no one should have to make--the choice between family and the one I love. How can this be? Why is this so?I leave you with this final thought: one day we will meet again, and our love will shine again, and each of us will be free to honorably continue this relationship.Goodbye, my love--for now.",1
"I'll always remember our first date until my memory fades. It's as if I was awakened from a deep sleep. I felt like breathing again. I never thought that someone could make me feel this alive. I'll surely treasure the memories we've shared till I grow old. It is true--you never realize what you have until you lose it.I want to tell you so many things. I want to share my feelings with you. I want to open my heart up. I haven't mustered enough courage to tell you what I feel for you. What I want to say is I've loved you since Day One. Since we said ""hello,"" I knew deep inside me, you'll be a part of me. I've loved everything about you.I don't want to lose our love. Let's talk about it.",1
"Do you know that I've fallen deeply in love with you? You always say: ""We'll be together forever"" and my heart melts. I've tried many times to let go of this relationship but every time I think of letting go, the thought is too painful.We have had some bad times, but the more arguments we had, the closer we got. I feel so close to you now that I believe I need you always by my side. I cannot imagine life without you; it would be horrible.I'm a girlfriend who loves you very much and I hope you can understand and that you feel love towards me.",1
"Through all those precious moments, magical times, and meaningful words--thank you. Even though we are no longer together, I want to say, ""thank you."" Know that I really want you back. I need you here, but I know I can't have you again because we've wasted our love too many times.I'm sorry for the times I was so self-centered and never had the time for you, sorry for those words I told you that discouraged you, sorry for the times I wasn't with you. If I could be given the chance to show you again how I really feel, and if I could have you back, I would never leave you again. I would spoil you so that you would know that I really do love you, even though I'm so far away.Life still goes on for both of us. I wish you will find that perfect girl who could really love you and you could love in return. Maybe she will be taller, prettier, smarter, and funnier than I am, and everything you want from a girl. I just want to say, she will be the luckiest girl in the world to have someone like you.I really don't want to lose you, but before I have to say ""goodbye"" again, I want to say, ""Thank you for loving me for just a little while. I'm so sorry. I will always love you.""",1
"It's been quite awhile since I've written you a letter. After all the times we've been apart, you're still the only one I'm longing for. You see, life has never been the same without you. Every day and every night, I fight this empty feeling but, try as I might, I can't win. It seems like you've captured my heart, and my heart can't escape.",1
"After knowing you as my love, you now say that it's over and that you love me only as a friend and that breaks my heart. I would do anything to spend the rest of my life with you. I know that it wouldn't be easy to stay together, but life isn't easy. To think that you can change your mind about loving me is painful.That is why I can't stay; if I leave, maybe I can put my heart at peace, and my mind at rest. I will always think of you and carry the memories of the love that once was but now I have lost.",1
"Every day I think about you. I miss you so much. I know too many things have happened for us to even try to work things out again. Too many nasty words were said between us. I know you will always be my best friend, and I will always love you and keep you in my heart.I think that with every day that goes by without you, you will become easier to forget, but you're not. It's actually harder every day to get over you and the kind of love that you and I shared. I know you still love me, and I still love you, but I don't think things will ever again be like they used to be.You are everything to me, and I know I was the one responsible for everything that has gone wrong between us, and for that I am forever sorry! Please forgive me for everything that I have done to you and to our relationship.I love you now and will continue to love you as time goes by.",1
"I need to tell you the full truth about the way I feel. The first time I ever saw you, I knew you were for me and I for you. The first eye contact between the two of us was the most powerful feeling of love from a man that I have ever had in my entire life. You took my breath away, and now that you're gone, I still find it hard to breathe.You treated me like a queen; you always were there for me and you showed me that gentlemen are still living in this society. I wish that I could touch you again, hold you, kiss your sweet lips, and spend the rest of my life in your arms. You are my soul mate and will always be in my heart more than any other man. I pray one day that you will realize this and come back to me.",1
"My sweet knight, I love you with all my heart and soul. When I am in your arms, you make all my worries disappear. I never felt so loved and so happy! I know with you everything is possible and our dreams are destined to come true. You love has taken up residence in my heart and I will never again be alone.You are truly sent from the heavens where the bravest and sweetest knights come from. I completely overjoyed to know that you will be my husband, and I will be your wife. The love I feel for you is often hard to put into words. I promise you my sweet knight that I will go the distance to show you how much I need you in my life and how much you will always mean to me. The love we have is the true love that belongs to two soul mates and will continue through eternity. I love you!I am soon to be your wife!",1
"When I hear your voice, my stomach aches. You were my first kiss, my first true love, my first everything. I met you unexpectedly, and from the beginning, you stole my heart.You never judged me or asked me to ever change anything about myself. You loved me for who I was and always made me feel beautiful. You tried to get me to love myself the way that you loved me, but I was insecure. My insecurities caused us to argue. I know we both made mistakes, but I fought with you more than I loved you, and I don't know why.I love you more than anything. You weren't just my love, you were my best friend. You were always there for me, but I let you get away. I know you love me and I know how you feel about me, which makes me think my dreams will still come true some day. You are my shinning star. Please shine for me again.",1
"It really hurt me so much when I learned about the other girl. It hurts when you're holding onto something in vain; something that really isn't there. Those times when you were near, I waited untiringly. It really broke my heart when I finally realized you never really loved me. If and when you had loved me, that was not enough for you to hold onto that feeling. I'm coping now, but uncertain when I can really say that I'll be over you. I dread the day that you'll be getting married, so I always ask the Lord to take away all this hurt and let me move on with my life.",1
"Seven days have passed and my life has changed. I can't see tomorrow, knowing that today is gone. I had everything with you and the kids, something called a family and a home. Now it's all memories with nothing in the future. My life has fallen apart. I look forward to the end of my pain, and yet I've felt the deepest pain a man can ever feel in his heart--a cut so deep that neither medicine nor time can heal it, all that remains is the pain of being alone.Give my love to the kids and tell them although I'm not there in flesh, my spirit looks over them.",1
"We rarely see each other or spend any time together anymore. Things seem changed. What has gone wrong? Do you want me to be in your future? Will you give this relationship the attention it deserves? How can a relationship survive if there is only one person doing the work of two? We are close only when we make love, but even that side of the relationship is suffering now.I'm not sure I can go on anymore the way things have been. I will let you go if I have to move on because we each deserve to be with someone who truly loves us.I do, however, want to give us one more try and if you too want to try, let's talk.",1
"What happened to us? The promise we made five years ago to say ""I love you"" every day, no matter what? I know I have shut you out in many ways, and that is only because of the distant and matter-of-fact attitude I sensed coming from you. I wish I could stop loving you, as you apparently have stopped loving me, but I have never lied to you and I won't start now.It was and always will be a special moment for me when you walked into my life. Like a prince, you turned my world into a fairytale of love and passion unknown to mankind before. I believed you when you told me we would always, ""If nothing else, let's be best friends."" Have you changed your mind?I realize you may never read this. I can only hope, as you used to tell me that this message, like a bottle at sea, will find its way to you and let you know that I will always love you, no matter what, and that these memories will never fade from within my soul. ""Soul mates,"" you said. If you believe that, then you don't need these words to know what I am feeling. Love hurts, and I know we have those circumstances in our lives that have kept us apart, but now I believe that if they weren't there, if it were just the two of us, we would still be where we are right now--a thousand miles from nowhere.I love you and I miss you. I don't know how to stop the pain of losing both a best friend and my first love. Be happy, my darling, and I will always wish upon a star that someday you will walk back into my life as you did once before.",1
"Even though I see you often, it's difficult for me to express my feelings to you, but I have so many things I need to share with you, that I will try. Many years have gone by since we were together, but I am still in love with you. I miss you and pray that one day we will be able to begin again where we left off.I am unsure how you feel about me and I hope that you will tell me. I wonder if you are living a happy life or are you, too, yearning for what something else.I wish I could be with you again, because I feel that I need you in my life. I'm afraid this might take a miracle, but I am hopeful.",1
"I never knew what true love was until I met you. From the first minute, I knew that you would be different from anyone that I had been with yet. And I was right. You were my first true love. I felt loved and loving when I was with you and, if I could rewind time, I would do a lot of things differently so we could still be together.You say that we can never be a couple. Well, in that case, I feel we both lost a true love. We had everything going for us right down to our families approving of our relationship. Have you thought about that? Even our friends thought that we could make it together and I would like to try one more time.If you would like to try, please call me. If I do not hear from you, well I guess I'll have to accept that I lost what was a true love.",1
"So much is on my mind, although I don't know where to start. To be honest with you, I really think our love is dying. Things don't seem to be the same anymore. I really love you and I want to be with you, but this is not how to go about it.The first time we broke up, you told me you wanted me back and that you loved me. It seemed like it was true, but now I don't know where our relationship stands. I'm feeling really confused. I don't know if I'm your girlfriend or just someone you can make love to. I need answers.What happened to you coming over here after work, or you calling me on your lunch break? You don't tell me you love me anymore, either. I really miss all of that and want things to go back to the way they were.I really wanted to tell you that when we saw each other at the game. You know what hurt the most? You didn't even come over and say, ""Hey,"" or give me a kiss, a hug, or anything, and I'm supposed to be your girlfriend. When do you plan on showing me that I am? It really hurts to know that my own boyfriend--the one who supposedly loves me--can't come over and say ""Hello,"" or anything, but when you're not with your friends and it's just you and me, that's another story.I'm just going to have to leave you. I don't want to do it, but I want things the way they used to be, and it looks like that won't happen. I love you but your love obviously isn't as strong as you say it is.I love you and that's for certain, and I always will.",1
"When did we decide that we wanted to be in a relationship? Or did it just happen? We seemed to get along and care for one another but then I began to feel hurt deeply and often. You criticized and made fun of me and I continued to wonder why and how did things change?And now you are gone and I wonder where you are in your feelings toward me? Do you regret how you mistreated me? I would never have imagined how much someone I once thought that I loved could hurt me. I still feel pain but it eventually turns to anger because I did not deserve the bad treatment.You wrote and said that you would like to try again. My answer is that I need some assurance that you will try to change your behavior. If yes, please call me.",1
"It's hard for me to start this letter. After I talked to you last night, I thought everything would be fine, but when I woke up this morning, I realized that I had wished it was only a dream. I told you that I'm not happy anymore, partly because I wasn't, but the real reason I said it was because I wanted to feel I was still special to you, that you still loved me, because you have changed so much. Lately, I feel you've taken me for granted. I don't know if I'm just being paranoid, but I really miss your sweetness, your presence, your care. Last night, I wanted to hear that you didn't want me to go because you still loved me, but instead you answered me back with coldness and indifference. It really hurt me a lot. I realized I still loved you, despite your attitude. Love you so much.",1
"My love, my sweet--I look back at the years we shared together, and how amazing my time with you was. Sometimes it breaks my heart to go that far down the road and be reminded of how much I loved you, how much we loved each other. I have never felt a love as deep and true as that which I had in my heart for you. How could two people that felt as if they could never live without each other, and then become so distant and far apart? How can a love that was meant to last, crumble right before our eyes? What happened to our love--what happened to us?I would never have thought that I could have questioned or doubted what we had. You're an amazing man and you've helped me to discover my dreams and inspired me to become the woman that I've always dreamed of becoming. I am a better person because of you--because you believed in me, because you loved me. I love you dearly with all my heart.I look in your eyes and see a love that is still there, but no longer radiant and alive. Does that mean that we stopped loving each other? Absolutely not. You are the dearest person in my life and will remain so. I love you with all my heart, but I accept that we are traveling on different paths. My love for you will always remain constant and my past memories of you will be relived in my dreams. Though our roads are different, our paths will still cross, now and then. Maybe someday, we will travel down the same path once more. Until then, my sweet love, you will always reside in my heart.I am unconditionally yours.",1
"I was afraid to fall in love so I kept up my guard. I was afraid to be dumped or used, but you showed me what true love is. You had been loved and left before, too, and I know that you were as scared as I was to get involved.I know I have done some things to hurt you, and I am really sorry. But now both our lives seem empty without one another. I know now how much I love you and I want you back.I want the house, the careers, the trucks, the kids, the animals, and the whole nine yards. My love for you continues to grow, and even though I will be gone for awhile, it will never fade. You are my one true love, and I hope you will be there for me. I trust you and love you with all my heart and soul. You are everything to me.",1
"Why did you leave me? Was she that much better that you wanted to hold her and not me? What made you decide that you were not right for me?You once held me when my world seemed empty. How could you leave me so suddenly? You broke my heart. You left me with only memories. I will never forget the time you kissed my hand, and I kissed you back so our pain would go away. But now there is another girl. Who is going to be there for me now to kiss away the pain you have caused? If you are moving on then I am too. If you want to think twice, call me.",1
"All I wanted from the start was to be with you. God knows how much you mean to me, not only as a friend, but with deeper, greater feelings as well.As you know me by now, this is a way for me to pour out my heart to you, to let you know it's dying because you're gone.You brought back the light into my life when all I could see was darkness. You brought back the smile to my face when all I could do was frown. Most importantly, though, you brought back the love and trust that I had lost for people. We shared plenty of moments where we opened up to each other and shared our secrets, our feelings of happiness, sadness, sometimes anger and intimacy. We promised each other that, no matter what, we would always be together because fate had decided we would be. But now you have decided that it's not what you want any more.How can this be? Why now? Why now when my heart fully belongs to you? Why now when I have fallen in love with you? Why now when I was ready to be with you for the rest of my life? I find fate can turn out so cruel and twisted; it's always getting my hopes up, just to bring them back down again. Each time the pain comes back, it's stronger and longer.Why did you do this to me, when you knew I would have done anything for you? When you knew that all my hopes and dreams surrounded you? When you knew that not having you in my life would cause me so much pain? But I know I can't change your mind and, more importantly, I can't change what you feel in your heart, so all I can do is ask you, why?I miss you every moment.",1
"March 20th was the hardest day of my life--I left you. But not only did I break up with you, I moved thousands of miles away! I wish that things could have been different, better, so we could have been together still.Every night I fall asleep thinking about you, wondering how you are, where you are, if you're alright, and if you still think of me, and miss me, and love me, like I do you. Every morning I awake, wishing I could kiss your lips again and be with you. I yearn for your love and everything about you; I hope one day we'll be together again. I know we were meant to be, so I know our paths will cross again, and we'll end up back in each other's arms, where we belong!I wish you were still mine! I miss you and love you so much!",1
"There was a time when I thought dreams were enough for a broken heart. I guess I was wrong. The stars in the sky lost all their meaning. At times I feel the need to cry, and the night can't hide my tears. I try to hold onto our memories, but that's not enough to fill the void in my heart. I'm over you, at least I keep telling myself that, but it's not true, I still love you.",1
"I have not stopped thinking of you since the last time I saw you. I know that it was difficult for you to share some of your experiences with me. It was hard for me too.And now I want to share some of my thoughts with you.I have carried with me a deep-seated hurt that seems to have no end. I kept telling myself that maybe I could have done more to let you see that I needed you in my life. But I didn't, because there was nothing more I could do. And the paradox is that I knew you hurt just the same when you turned away; I knew that you did not want to part. I knew I had to respect your wishes and give you your personal space.I don't have the answer to why I started missing you so soon. In spite of my good promise to call you and keep in touch, I let my life get so busy that time has slipped by. I could have gotten in touch sooner. I hope you know that I meant to call. There was not a single day that went by without a loving thought of you.I remember that you even made things okay when I was at my lowest with family matters or with work. You made me realize how precious and fragile love is. You were my lover, my teacher, and my friend. In short, you made a great difference in my life.We are not together now but I am grateful for what we had and wish you would call.",1
"Baby, I miss you so much! It seems like forever since I saw you last. Every day now is just like the one before. I sit around just thinking about you, wishing you were still mine. The thought that you belong to somebody else is too painful to bear.I wonder sometimes if you tell her that you love her and that she is the perfect girl, like you once told me. Do you tell her the stories that you told me? And the song, ""Unanswered Prayers,"" do you tell her that it reminds you of her?Maybe someday we will find each other again and appreciate each other more. You are the love of my life, and I know you still love me too. Good-bye for now. I love you.",1
"I know I am in love because I see you every way I turn--no matter what I am doing. I know I want to be with you, not just with you, but share everything with you, too. Just being close to you is not enough for me. I want to be a part of you; A part of your life forever. I never have to wonder if you love me. You complete me--my heart and my soul.You're my best friend, my lover, and my soul mate. You have been there and supported me like no one else has before. I'm lost without you. I love you more than life itself. There are no words I can say to truly tell you how much I really love you. I couldn't picture myself without you in my life. You are perfect for me in every possible way, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.You give me reason to strive for more of everything. I learn more and more from you every day. My heart is forever yours. I know saying, ""I love you"" is powerful, yet I feel it's not enough. My life was a wreck before now. I never thought it would change, but you came into my life and everything took a turn for the best. You show me the value of life. You give me the most amazing feelings inside. It feels great to actually love and be loved in return. We have been friends for over three years now, and I know we have only been dating for a short time now, but I know our love will last a lifetime. I can't wait until I am your wife. I love you with all my heart. I am yours forever.",1
"I love you so very much sweetheart. You are the love of my life. I have a hard time explaining how I feel. I have never felt anything like this before. You are always there for me no matter what. I do not know what I would've done this week without your love and support. You are the most loving, caring, compassionate and absolutely most awesome guy that I have ever met. My last boyfriend holds a special place in my heart, but you have gone way above and beyond him.I never thought that was possible. I want to marry you now; I want to be your wife. I want a baby with you; that is the most awesome experience, nothing compares to that. You are a wonderful father to our kids, but you deserve more. Thank you for always being there, for the flowers--they are beautiful, for your kind words, hugs, kisses, and the unconditional love. You are a dream come true and I want to spend the rest of my life with you as your wife, lover, and best friend. I have never in my life been so very happy. I feel much loved, beautiful and very happy.I'm so very proud of you. You are a very strong person. It is really cool that we are strong for each other in different ways. We totally understand each other and feel for each other. When you hurt, I hurt. When you are happy, I'm happy. I just love you so much sweetheart and I never want to lose you. I give you my heart, my love and my life for now and forever. I love you.",1
"Every time I see you smile or laugh or just acting goofy, it makes me proud to be your husband, and it always makes my day so much fun! Also, when you are with the kids, I see that they are proud of their mom because she is so much fun, so smart, and so loving! When I put all of this together, the best of life is with you, and the kids and I are so glad that you belong to us! We love you very much!",1
"I don't know where I should start! Let me start by saying, I love you. I have loved you for as long as I can remember. I guess the first time I told you was when I realized how much you meant to me. We have known each other for years now. Once we got together, I couldn't believe how good things were going. It was too good to be true. It was perfect in the beginning. I loved you, and you loved me. I felt like that's the way it should still be.I didn't want you to leave. Honestly, I didn't. If I could go back, I'd beg you to stay by my side. To know you'd be miles away was breaking my heart, but I wanted you to be happy. I wanted you to make a good future for yourself, for us. Now that I think about it, how could I have let you go? What was I thinking then? Look what has happened.I know we've been through tough times. And because of that I think we have become stronger than we know. We have lasted a good while together, too. I'm so incredibly sorry for everything that I did wrong. I wish you could just tell me, and I would change it all. You know, though, neither one of us were innocent when it came to hurting each other.When I said I would marry you, I meant it. I wanted to live my entire life loving you. We could have grown old together. I know you wanted that. It would have been great. But what happened to us? Where did we go wrong? Wasn't our love untouchable? Wasn't it strong? I sit and think, and the only thing that best explains it is that we needed to be together physically. Having you in one state and me in another was unbearable. Although I really wanted to be with you, I also had school and my life here. If I could go back, I'd probably leave with you when I had the chance. Would things be better now, or is this the way it was supposed to be?All I know is we may not be together for a long time or maybe not ever again. But I want you to know that you are someone I will never ever forget. I loved you, and still love you, and will always love you, no matter what. We've been through a lot. But that love is still there. I hope you find happiness. I hope all your dreams come true. You deserve a lot.I feel very lucky to have had the chance to experience the love we once had. It's something I will forever cherish. Please don't forget it. I know things aren't the best now, but at least we still have our friendship. That's where it all started. I just ask for one thing: be happy, and know that I'm happy too. I will always think about you--and us.",1
"I am so glad to be loved by someone as special as you are. I thought for a long time that nobody could ever make me happy and win my hardened heart until I met you. You've really changed my life and I thank God I am loved and cherished by someone like you. You brought a sweet love into my life.I love you so much. You mean more than anything in this world to me. I thank God I found you, and I will do my best to keep your sweet love in my life.",1
"I never expected to meet a man like you. You are so amazing and unique. I admire your voracious appetite for life, your strength and courage, your intelligence, your take charge, the-world-be-damned attitude. I admire your adventurous and energetic spirit.I think of you as a pioneer of sorts--enthusiastic, confident, dynamic, and quick-witted. Of course, at times, your immense energy makes you seem aggressive and restless, headstrong and quick-tempered, but I love these qualities, too, because I know that your love for life and your love for me are what drive you.In the end, I love all that which is essential to your nature. I love the warrior within you, and there is no one else on earth I would rather be with, or who I would rather give myself to, or who can make me as happy or as content with life as you do!",1
"I want to thank you for all the support you've shown me. Thank you for giving me the courage to fight for our love. After all the pain, sacrifices, and hardships that we've been through, it's all worth it because of the outcome. I want to thank you for your trust, for understanding all my tantrums and, of course, for loving me and accepting who I really am. Thank you for the patience, because I know that sometimes I'm stubborn and childish. You know I can't imagine my life without you. For the past eight months, you've really left a mark on my life. You taught me how to fight for something that is truly worthwhile. You taught me how to trust myself and, for all that, I love you so much!",1
"At first, I was worried about our differences. I was worried we had come from places too far apart, and that our families would not accept our bond. But I was wrong to have these fears. Our connection is stronger than anything. Our love is so very great.I guess I never thought I would find someone like you, someone who hears every word in my heart, and someone who makes me laugh and brings me strength. Across time and space, across cultures and borders, and against all odds, we've come together, and I am indescribably thankful! We have been given a gift, and we must treasure it always. Let's love each other forever. Let's stay together forever.",1
"Re: In Spite of the OddsWhen I think of all the billions of people on earth and then realize that you and I met in spite of the odds, it makes me humble and grateful. We are so happy together and devoted to one another, and I pray this continues. I promise you I will do all that I can to keep on making our relationship a happy success!Let's promise one another we'll keep on being true, honest, and caring. I promise you, here and now, as you promised me, so long ago, that I will always love you.",1
"On this day, I promise my undying love to you, in sickness and in health, my continuous effort to make it work, and that all my love is yours and only yours. I hope and pray that this fairytale you have made my life stays and that we're good friends to the very, very end in our minds, bodies, and spirits. I love you with all my heart and soul. I love you far, far beyond my control and I always will, because what we share is more beautiful than the colors of any rainbow and they will never fade in days or only appear in rain. I love the feeling of happy tears rolling down my face. I love the taste of you when I kiss you, because it's an everyday sweetness, it's meek and it's willing. You've made my ending a new beginning. There are no other words in the dictionary to describe the very scary commentary that I am sharing. I will love you, Baby, throughout this life and beyond.",1
"My love, you have this power over me, this indescribable, undeniable, unmistakable power. You consume my mind. You are always invading my thoughts. You are the ruler of my dream world. You bring a smile to my face, a sparkle to my eyes, and a tear to my cheek.Your voice is like a sweet song I heard for the first time. You take my breath away with the simplest words your lips utter. You make me feel weightless, as though I could float up and touch the heavens above. You make me look at life through new eyes, eyes that have never seen the light of day until now. I feel as though I am using all my senses for the first time and, suddenly, everything I once knew is now unfamiliar to me. You fill every cell in my being with joy, love, and happiness. You make me want to stand up and scream at the top of my lungs, ""I love you, more than words can say."" You make my heart soar, like a bird in flight. But most of all, you are you, and I love you.It is this intense power you have over me that gives me strength and hope, and gives my life new meaning. You are my sun, my moon, my evening star, my light, my life, my love. You are my destiny. You are the only one, the man that I love. As I write this love letter to you, I find the words come naturally to me. It's as if this pen is an extension of my heart, and my heart is guiding it across the paper. Every letter, every word, every stroke is meant to be because we are soul mates, and our love was meant to be.",1
"Here's to a man I thought I'd never know! The one who stole my heart so innocently, but with care and grace, and perfect love. My perfect thought is just being together forever. The sweetest word I say is your name. And the greatest thing to imagine is your love. Every silent prayer that has left my mind, all the empty words that have chased my lips and left my mouth, and all the lonely tears that have escaped my eyes have made me who I am, one who just loves you more.All the guys who just wanted my body, all the pieces of myself I've given away, all the things I had wished I had done, and all the things I wished I hadn't done just helps me love you with purity and certainty. Those times we start to fight makes me feel like we're gambling our very souls. I hope we never lose. I love you so much; those five words can't have any more meaning than anything else I say ever possibly could. I love you with all that I am--all my achievements as well as all my faults. I love you for all that you are, too. I hope in the quiet of the night when I call out your name, you will know it and hear my voice whispering how much I love you.",1
"I have been making so many mistakes in our relationship. I have misunderstood your words so many times, but you have always forgiven me. You always give me another chance to show that my love for you is real, and I can never fully thank you for your kindness and compassion.You have shown me the one true way of living! You have shown me that we only move through life once and that we always need to cherish our time with each other. I feel privileged to have you in my life and I hope we always stay together. When I say that I love you, I mean it with all of my being. When I say that I love you, I smile with joy!",1
"Thank you for loving me and caring so much for me! Knowing that you are always there for me, and that you'll always be there for me is more important than I can express. Even when I mess up, even when I hurt you mistakenly and say something stupid, you always forgive me with such patience and compassion that you help me grow stronger and better. Somehow, you even end up loving me more! You're a wonderful person, and you're the most amazing partner I could imagine. I love you so much! Thank you for just being you.",1
"It's hard to express how much you mean to me, but consider this: no matter what I am doing, you are in my thoughts. It's not a choice I really have. I simply love you and think of you all the time. Whether moving through chores at home, working at the office, eating a meal, or just walking around--no matter what, you are always with me. No matter what I am doing, I think of the strength of our love, the way we hold each other, and the way you whisper in my ear. I know, from the bottom of my heart, that we are meant to be together forever. I love you so very much!",1
"To put it simply, you are the greatest thing that has ever happened to me. You keep me going through all the ups and downs of life. You are my best friend, someone who truly listens to me, someone who knows me almost better than I know myself! You are my perfect lover, the perfect match for my body and my soul. With you by my side, the world is open and wonderful. We can make anything happen together!Many things in life may be uncertain, but I want you to know that whatever happens, in whatever direction our lives unfold, I will always be there for you. I will always cherish you and support you. I will always want to be with you and, always, I will love you.",1
"You have stood by my side through everything now. You have guided me through dark moments and have shared my hopes and secrets. You have nurtured me back to health when I have been ill. You have done for me what no one else has done before and I love you so much for it.You and I know that many things change over time. Places change, ideas change, and some people even change. My love for you, however, never will. From now until the end of our lives, I will be yours and yours alone. I will be your best friend, your lover, and your husband. I will always stand by your side--and never change!",1
"In my daydreams, I see the way you look at me with complete understanding and with the warmth that takes my breath away. Then I wonder if I dreamt all of those wonderful moments we have shared. Have I dreamt all the words we uttered to describe how we feel toward one another?The incredible love that I feel for you makes my head spin and my heart responds with strong emotions. There is a strong feeling that this dream will never end. But am I dreaming? I close my eyes and I see you as you were when we last said goodbye. Then the phone rings and it is you. Your words reassure me that I am not dreaming. I am grateful, and I will love you always.",1
"Well, here we are 10 years later and I am as devoted to you as I was on the day we were married. I still miss you when you leave for the day, and I can't wait for you to return every night. You are my love, my life, and the strength that guides me through all the rough times. Remember that I am here for you, too, forever and for always.I promise to keep you in loving arms for the rest of our lives.I promise to love, honor, and cherish you until the end of time.I promise to be here for you, whenever you need me.I promise to be your soul mate as we grow old together.I will be your faithful spouse for all eternity.I give you my heart and soul for all eternity.I love you just for being you, for your humor, and for your kindness. You are the only person who has ever made me feel this way, and my heart is yours forever.",1
"I promise that I will always love you, no matter what. Although you might think that I don't, I do. I have so much respect for you. You were the one that was there for me when I needed someone, and I appreciate that. I really want to be with you and no one else. Why? Because I feel in my heart that you are the only one for me in this world. No one else can fill your shoes, and it has been proven. Whenever you are ready, I am here for you, my love.",1
"I feel incredibly fortunate to have you in my life. Please don't mind if I appear to be arrogant in talking about our love, and please don't mind if I appear to gloat about our love. Don't mind if I appear to be absent-mindedly smiling all the time--I'm only thinking about you.It's true: over this first year together, we have been through a lot of ups and downs. Like most couples, we had our share of good and bad--arguments, temporary breakups, heated discussions, and passion. We've been through it all.What is unique about our relationship is that we go through each difficulty, each complexity, and always come out of it loving each other all the more. I know I can be a total jerk sometimes. I know I can be almost impossible to live with. But one thing is very clear to me: I love you more than words can express.Let's celebrate our first year together. Let's celebrate the many more years to come. Let's celebrate our love.Happy Anniversary!",1
"Our belated anniversary comes with my humble commitment to serve you for life. To give you the joy of a relationship that lets you be yourself, because I know and identify with the human being in you. Sure, I don't claim to understand everything that you care about, but I will always strive to listen with my heart and reach out for the emotionally complex being in you, to understand how best my life can serve yours and support you, fulfilling the purpose for which your life is meant. On this year's anniversary and beyond, it is with my life and with the life that we hope to create together that I say I love you. By seeking your hand to build a family and to pass on the gift of life to our children, I am saying I love you, not only in this life and beyond, but for all eternity. I wish you a blissful anniversary and many more to a selfless lady with so much integrity and grace, worthy of the true gift of love. I love you, and I always will.",1
"A few years ago, I had totally given up on love. I thought that nobody was out there for me. I thought that the ache in my heart would forever go unfulfilled. I even began to think that love itself might be an illusion. But then you entered my life and, suddenly, love was real. It was a fact, and it was everywhere. After only a short time, my heart finally felt whole, and I knew you were the cause. You were the answer I had been looking for deep inside. I knew, without a doubt, that you were the only one for me.Thank you for entering my life. You have brought me such joy. I will love you for the rest of my days!",1
"First of all, I would like to say I love you with all my heart! I will never forget the first day that we met. I remember each and every detail. Meeting you has been an answer to my prayers. I will always love you. My heart belongs to you and ONLY you. I never want you to forget that. I didn't think it was possible to fall in love with someone so fast, but knowing you has totally proved me wrong. I am truly happy to be with you. You are everything to me and I will do anything for you. I will never leave your side and, when you have to leave me, I will be right here waiting for you to come back.Each and every kiss feels like the first one, and my love for you grows stronger as the days go by. I love you with all my heart and soul, and I always will. Baby, I love you!",1
"I am writing this letter because I can't bear the pain in my heart when you are so far away from me. Although I can't see you or hear your voice, writing these words and expressing these feelings somehow helps, and it somehow connects us across the time and space of our separation.I still remember the day when I first kissed you. A tear rolled down your cheek, and you said, ""Don't ever leave me."" On that day, I swore that I'd be there for you, and be forever by your side. I swore that I'd forever love you and be yours and yours alone.My conviction is as strong today as it was then, and it will remain so through my last breath. For the energy that you bring into my life, for the joy and passion, for the kindness and affection, I will be forever grateful. Whether I am young or old, or I am sick or healthy, you are more important to me than anything. All of my love is yours.",1
"Although we are apart, I want you to know that I still feel you with me. When I look out my window and see the stars in the sky, or when I watch birds land in a tree, I feel you with me. Though you may be far away, these same stars, this same sky, and these same birds--they are all part of your world as well. Across time and space, through air and water, we will share it all.I can't deny, though, that I miss you terribly. I miss your kiss and your embrace. I miss making love to you or falling asleep in your arms, but this period apart will pass. We must only remain patient and remember the depth of our connection and love. Soon enough, we will hold each other again, and we will build a life together.",1
"Just when I thought my heart was turning cold, and I thought the questions of longing inside me would never be answered, you joined my life and everything changed. You woke me up to the wonders around me and made me see that love is real, and that with love everything is a blessing.I can never fully thank you for the joy you bring to me. I want you to know that even if my commitments separate us sometimes, even if we are worlds apart, I will trust you with my heart. Although there are few guarantees in this life, I will love and cherish you with my last breath--that much I promise you. My love for you is true. No matter what happens, my love for you will always remain.",1
"I think about you every second of every day and cannot wait to see you. We should never be apart this long again! Even if we have to change our lives completely, I am willing to do it so that we can always be together.Life is no fun without you. Emails and phone calls are great, but there is nothing like holding you and seeing your face as we talk.I hope we are never separated again.",1
"Do you remember how we looked at each other across the room before we first met? Do you remember the silence between us, a silence that was thick with the yearning of our hearts? Even then, before the first words passed between us, and before you first kissed me and held me in your arms, I knew things were never going to be the same for me.Since that day, every detail, every ray of sunshine, every passing thought--all is now filled with my love for you. You light up my world with your affection, your warmth, and your passion. You bring me joy and comfort with your humor and trust, as well as make me feel secure and loved with your strength and sincerity. I am so thankful to you. You are far better than a dream, and I love you!",1
"Our life seems to be full of complexities. At times we laugh, at other times we shed tears. Once in a while we just stare at each other and, yeah, also fight. Nonetheless, despite all of our apparently inconsistent ideas, we manage to move forward and survive together. We might have caused each other pain that might not even fade with any word of apology. Nevertheless, I am confident that everything that we've gone through is merely part of a strong structure that heaven is building for us. I love you so much! To say this a million times is not enough to express how much I really do. I love you dearly and still will beyond the stars.",1
"I hope today turns out to be a memorable day for you. If only I were with you now, I would help you celebrate. There are no words to express my feelings to you other than to wish you happy birthday, and to tell you that I love you. I thank God every day for making you a part of my life.I wish you peace and special memories of our loving times together and, at the end of this day, a sense of complete happiness. Sweet dreams, my love, and happy birthday! I look forward to coming home again soon.",1
"I need you to know that I have never encountered a wonder as marvelous as you are. In your presence, the most basic of sights and the most basic of activities radiates the full potential and beauty of this world. Such joy and clarity overcomes me when we're together and, although it has been only hours since our last meeting, already I feel we have been apart for ages. Every minute, every thought until our next encounter moves more slowly by than I can bear.I am truly overcome with admiration for you and blinded with love. I wait, minute after minute, second after second, till I once again stand beside you and hold your hand, and so I can once again speak to you with more than words. Let us be together again soon.",1
"I know at times I act crazy and do stupid things. I know at times I'm the one who gets things started. I also know that even when we are arguing or mad at each other, we still love each other. If they could ever hear us argue, some people would say that we are not going to make it because, well, we can get harsh, but they do not know us. Baby, nobody knows what I have had to do to get where I am. Nobody knows what you had to do to get where you are. Nobody knows us, except for us. Baby, nobody knows about the things in my past that I had to overcome to trust you. Nobody knows what you had to overcome. Nobody knows about how scared I was of you because of what one person did to me. So many people think that I am crazy for falling in love with you, but how can they judge someone that they do not know?It mystifies me how so many people can try to tell me what I need when they do not even know me. It hurts that the people who are supposed to know me try to take my happiness away. You know about my past, you know that I have a hard time trusting, and you know that at times it is hard for me to put my feelings into words. I know that we have problems, but we always work them out.Everyone sees you as the person that you used to appear to be, but you are far from it--and always were. You treated me better than people that are in my family. You brighten my life. You are my life. Every promise that you have made me, you have kept. You always know when something is wrong, and you always know what to do to cheer me up. You were there for me at the time that I needed you most. You were there when nobody else was. You were the bridge over troubled water, and you calmed me with your love.Baby, I am writing this to tell you that I love you more than anything, and I would do anything to be with you for the rest of my life. Thank you for waiting for me--waiting for me to give my heart to you. Today, I want you to know that I am starting over--we are starting over. I want us to be happy. I know that even the so-called best couples have their problems, but I do not want our problems to hurt us in any way. I do not want my bridge to fall down. Baby, today I promise that I will do everything that I can to keep us together.",1
"I can feel the butterflies now, just thinking about you, and I know smiles are on my face, too. I think you know the feeling, Babe. There have been hard times, and we've proven how strong our love is just by getting through them. Baby, this is something deeper than short-term feelings, it is extra special true love.When I feel cold, the warmest place to go is into our world, filled with eye contact, kisses, deep conversation, hugs, and BUTTERFLIES! I think we're both pretty new to this and are still learning. We will grow stronger as long as we're always there for each other. I love you so much.",1
"The day we first met, I remember that I didn't even want to speak to you. You tried so hard for me to like you. Finally, I realized that you were trying to get my attention. You weren't really my type, but once I got to know you more each day, I learned that love doesn't have a type. Love can go either way and, if you hide from love (like I hid from your love), eventually it will find you anyway, like yours found me. Sometimes love can change directions, or there might not be enough to go around fully. Even though we had some problems, I always loved you.",1
"Do you remember when we first met? I do. So long ago, but it is still like yesterday to me. Well, I'm more in love with you now than ever. I love it when you come home on late nights and tuck me in, caress my forehead and tell me you love me while I'm still awake. The way you leave me little presents and love notes in my jacket pocket. This is what love is. Taking time to read the love poems I send to you and not laughing at them. You care about me. Thank you for still doing all these things after all these years. I love you. The most important thing isn't the gifts, the notes, or the candy. It's the fact that you spend time thinking about me and that's the real gift. Thank you for being you, my darling--c'est l'amour.",1
"How do you say ""thank you"" to someone who has just given you a chance to experience something so wonderful that it is frightening?How thankful I am that it was you, my love, with whom I shared so many cherished moments. ""Thank you"" seems so small in comparison to the size of the world you've shown me.You will always be the one who took time out of his busy life to show me how much I have missed. I will be forever grateful to you.I think this saying is so true, ""Life is not measured by the breaths that we take, but by the moments that take our breath away."" Those cherished moments took my breath away! I will always remember the one who took my breath away so easily.",1
"Could you forget all the hurtful words that we've said to one other? I am hoping that you could forget the wrong paths that we seem to have moved into. Could you forget all the pain, all the tears, and all the silly accusations? Could you please forget all the foolishness of my fears that made me say such hurtful things? I hope you can forget and forgive all those ugly words that I said. I decided long ago that I would forget and forgive it all, too, if something like this happened. I certainly will, I just don't want to forget you. Can we get together and talk these things over? I will call soon to see if we can.",1
"I know that I may seem to change my mind too often about some things, but I want you to always remember that I will never change my mind about you and my love for you. We have a good relationship, and I want it to stay on course and develop into an even better one. Other things may change around us, but I will always feel the same about you.I will always be someone that you can count on, and I'll always be there for you, whether you are happy or sad. You can count on my love as a sure thing, and that will never change.",1
"When we first met, you and I were both emerging from unhappy relationships, but we helped each through them. We confided in one another, we comforted one another, and we healed one another. We built strong trust and communication and, before long, we were deeply in love.I fall deeper in love with you every day. I can't tell you how much you mean to me, or how much I love to just be with you. You make me smile and laugh out loud! You make me feel comfortable, confident, and protected. For the first time in my life, I feel whole and fully alive, and it's all because of you. I love you!",1
"I'm sure you've noticed how much my love for you has grown, and how much I depend on you and ask for your help. It might all be a bit sudden, I know, but it's become crystal clear to me that there is nobody on this planet more perfect for me than you are. Nobody but you could give me this confidence and this deep sense of purpose and connection. Nobody but you could make me feel so beautiful and secure. With every bit of my heart, I love you and am thankful for you. Please stay with me and let me love you forever.",1
"In this world of uncertainties, only one thing is certain beyond a doubt: you are all I need and all I want. You are the air moving through my lungs. You are the blood coursing through my veins. You are everything to me, and with you in my life, worries seem no longer possible.Our time together has been such a blessing. I can never express my gratitude for the ways you have changed my life. I can never express my gratitude for your open arms, your comforting words, and your caring thoughts. I have fallen deeply for you, and I know there's no turning back. Until my last breath, I am yours. I will love you forever!",1
"Before meeting you, I had never felt this kind of love before or this kind of passion and joy. Before meeting you, I never imagined I could feel happy all of the time, from morning until I begin dreaming at night. Now my world is changed and everything seems wonderful and bright. Because of you, everything now feels warm and secure. In your arms, I feel the whole world is open to me.There are no words to properly thank you for all that you have done for me or to fully express my deepest feelings to you. I can only say, ""thank you,"" and hope that in those two words you hear the sincere love and relief in my heart. I can only say, ""I love you,"" and hope that you hear the longing and affection in my soul!",1
"Although you and I have not been together for very long, I already feel so deeply in love with you. I already feel that we are building a life together and that our worlds are one. Honestly, I thought love like this was only in fiction, but you have proven me wrong.I wish I could describe my love for you, but it would truly take forever. I love every single detail, every single moment that we are together. I could never describe it all, but I can say that you are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I can say that I love you with all my heart and soul, and that I am yours for life.",1
"You don't realize how much you mean to me. Although we've been together for only a year, I feel as though I've known you my entire life. My connection to you is already so deep, and my love for you is already so strong that I can't imagine what my life was like before we met. Even more, I can't imagine my life without you now. I can't imagine the future without you, either.You have saved my life several times already. You have even saved me from myself several times, too! I am so thankful for your guidance and care. Whenever I'm having a bad day, I know that I can just give you a call. I know I can depend on you and, with your help, everything will turn out well.I want you to know how I really feel. It's time for you know that I'm ready to move on farther, to build a life, to have your children, and to grow old together. You are my first and only true love. Don't ever forget how much I love you.",1
"When we are together, I treasure every minute. When you speak tender words to me and say that you love me with all your heart, and that you will never leave me, I feel like the king of this world. I feel that anything is possible!Together, I know that we will accomplish so much. I am entirely confident of that. We will move through our days together in joy and happiness. We will always have each other for support, for passion, for intimacy, for confidence, and for dignity. Our love will last from now through the end of our lives.",1
"Most people see not what they want to in life, but what they expect to have and achieve. As for me, the moment that I met you, a war began. The war of Love vs. Denial. My objective after meeting you was to remain friends and only friends. Except one thing went terribly wrong--I knew that divine love had me under attack. I was lost, alone, and afraid; the thought of loving you scared me. I have seen through the battle and come out on top. I love more than I could ever love any human being. You are my man, my ray of sunlight after the rain, my piece of cake when sweets are craved, and my everlasting joy. I love you, because you put me under love's divine attack. This is one battle that I am glad to have lost and share the prize of never-ending love.",1
"I love you with every part of my being. If I could marry your soul, I would. I dream of nobody else. Every day is a true struggle when I'm not with you. If I could conjure up all the power in the world to translate my love to every form of living--physical and spiritual--I would. You are everything to me, and I love you more than life itself. I love you truly!I can't even begin to express how happy I am that you have come into my life. You are a gift from God! You are such an amazing man! Your kindness, your loving and sweet ways make my heart very happy. Your great sense of humor keeps me laughing and laughing, which is something I love and have needed for so long. We are such a great match. I love how we keep on spoiling each other. I look forward to many adventures, and much passion and pleasure with you--anything, anytime, anywhere.",1
"I wish I knew the way you feel about me. I care so much about you, but I constantly question my feelings. I know that we have had our bad times, but you and I both know there is an important reason why God has brought us back together. We just need to figure that out together.Most people, when they say they are in love, usually mean that they love the thought of one person, but I really love everything about you. I love your beautiful eyes and that little twinkle in them. I love the way you make me feel special. The point of this letter is to let you know how I feel and to say that I wish I knew how you feel about me. Do you care about me, and do you care enough to want to make our relationship last? I know I care about you.",1
"You are truly the love of my life. I wish I could have told you myself, instead of someone else saying it for me. I wish you weren't afraid to take off your cool reserve and be the real you. I won't hurt you or make you sad. I'd never deliberately cause you any pain, because love doesn't want to cause pain, only joy. I hope you understand how your smile brightens my day. Even the thought of you makes my heart pump harder.I wish that you were not afraid of a close relationship. Please don't think that you will be hurt again. I promise to never hurt you. If I do, I want you to tell me immediately, so that I can try to change things. If you promise to consider a close relationship, I promise to help you not to be afraid of it, because I love you.",1
"Honey, you know with you by my side, my day seems happier and full of love. When I heard that you never felt so much in love, I just wanted to be with you, to hug and kiss you until we both ran out of breath. I must be the luckiest girl in the world because I have your love. Every time I think about you, I can't help but smile. You're the reason I smile all the time now. I love you, Honey. I heard that you cherish everything between you and me. That's really great. I never thought I would have such a lasting influence on you.Thanks for your sweet and tender love. We need to write our own book of love! Please take care of yourself, and I will be yours, all yours--if you will be mine!",1
"Every time I see you, I fall in love with you more and more. I love the way you smile, the way you see beauty in little things, even the way you occasionally get too excited as you analyze everything. I love the way you are passionate about your job, your friends, your family, and I love it when you are passionate about me. I know that we are meant to be together, and I feel like you are starting to realize this too. I know that we can be so happy together. I can see us as a married couple, a family of two that may grow to be three or more. If all these things do come about, I know that I will be falling in love with you even more.",1
"Who would have thought five years ago we would be feeling like this now? My heart had been frozen for a long, long time, and then you melted it. I didn't intend to fall in love with you. I know we have complications and kinks to work out still, but I believe in you and I believe in us. I want you like I had never wanted anybody before I met you. I don't want to even imagine not having you in my life anymore. When we have to spend any days apart, I am in agony. I miss you, long for you, and count the minutes till we can be together again. I can't wait to be by your side every night, forever. Until I see you again, let me just say, I love you.",1
"I was at a crossroads until I met you. I didn't know where my life was going, and I felt lost. For months and months I couldn't figure out the problem. For months and months, something felt missing in my life--something felt confused and out of place. When I met you, though, the answer appeared, and the jigsaw of my life finally came together.Where before there was uncertainty, now there is calm. Where there was darkness and clouds, now there is light and the clear, open sky. Where there was fear and sadness, now there is hope and love. You brought all of this into my life. With your wonder and beauty, you opened my heart to the world. You brought me more fully to life, and I will forever love you for it.",1
"I loved it when you said you could feel the Earth move when we were together. When I think of this whole big world and its billions of people, I wonder how we even found each other! I will be eternally grateful that I found you and that you found me. I think we are a perfect match!How easy it would have been not to show any interest in one another when we first talked. Instead, we both chose to listen as we looked into each other's eyes, and I felt there was an immediate rapport. Didn't you, too? We understood that the person we were meeting would be different and unique. That realization was quick and very real.Now we have a chance to expand our love. Finding each other was a miracle and keeping our love alive will be another part of that miracle. I promise to do all that I can to keep us together, and I know that you will, too.",1
"I don't know how to express what I really feel for you right now. I just want to say I'm sorry for all the pains, sorry for all the heartaches, and I'm so sorry I fell in love with you so deeply. I never thought you'd be my sweetest angel.The day I met you, I never thought that I would fall in love with you. I never did imagine that you'd conquer my heart. I don't want to lose you now. I can't deny the fact that I can't live without you. Please stay with me. I would be dying without you. Thank you for the love you have given me already. I know I'll always love you. Please be my sweetest angel forever. I love you so much.",1
"Before we went out on that first date, I had doubts that you would be everything you portrayed yourself to be. I didn't think it was possible to find someone so perfect for me in so many ways. You have shown me that love can be true, pure, and genuine. I knew from the beginning that you were special and that it was only a matter of time before I fell helplessly in love with you. You make me so happy and fulfill me so completely. I thank God each and every day for bringing you into my life. When I look into your eyes, I see a future of endless possibilities and everlasting love. You are my forever.",1
"It has been the most amazing five months of my life and I've experienced things I have never known before. We have come a very long way and stuck by each other's side through a lot of painful moments. You have shown me what it is like to love and be loved, and that's given me happiness. That's all I need to have the most amazing life I could ever have, and I have you to thank for it.To be mature, you usually have to be an adult who has lived a certain number of years. But to be in love, you only have to be a human being with a heart. Parents shouldn't try to prevent their children from falling in love with someone because of their age or for some other reason. You can't really stop love from happening, and you can't put your feelings on hold because someone is telling you to. I love you, and I can't stop my feelings or wait until my mom thinks it is okay to love you. You are everything to me, and I can't give you up willingly. I don't think I can live if living is without you.Honey, you are one of a kind and are the most amazing person I've ever known. You understand me and care about me more than anyone else has ever done before. You are so caring and wonderful. You are beautiful. We have a healthy relationship that is going to last a lifetime because you and I are willing to work out anything that needs to be worked out. We communicate and, even if sometimes it's hard to tell each other our feelings, we still understand each other by looking in each other's eyes. We have our love songs, too, and those lines that just seem to fit us like, ""It's just a matter of trust."" It plays over in my head every time I think of you or, ""Sometimes all I need is the air that I breathe and to love you,"" whenever I hold you.We are going to have an amazing family and an amazing life ahead of us. I know now that what we have is so very true because it feels so right. Those beautiful eyes glow whenever I look at you or our eyes meet, and my whole being feels electrified. I wrote this letter to you from the bottom of my heart--from my heart to yours. I love you and will forever.",1
"Words cannot express the love song in my heart. You fill my days with magic, a magic I had thought impossible. Each morning, I awake beside you with renewed hope and happiness.Not even in a lifetime could I truly express the depth of my love for you. Even the wide heavens above could not hold all the feelings in my heart--and every feeling is for you!I have seen prayers answered before, but you are beyond the category of prayers. I am grateful that happy tears swell my eyes. I feel I am truly the most blessed man alive. You satisfy me, you fulfill me, and I want you to know that I will love you forever. I want a lifetime with you!",1
"You are my king and my prince. You are my knight in shining armor. We have so much in common. I am so glad we like the same things--like eating out at Italian restaurants and watching romantic comedies. I can't believe you were ever shy, but I am glad you broke out of your shell after you met me.I know you have been hurt in the past, and I will never hurt you like that--I promise you. I am yours as I hope you are mine, forever and always. I want to spend my life loving you. I want you to be the last man I ever kiss from this time forward. I hate that we ever broke up that one time, but I think it made us think about it and realize what we were losing. I cherish each and every day with you now. You are the first thing I think of in the morning and the last thing at night. I love to hear you laugh, see you smile, and just talk to you. You have a way about you. You are irresistible to me, and I don't know how anyone could be dumb enough to let you go. I know I never will again.I didn't used to be romantic, but you taught me how to be. You have taught me so much, and I admire your wisdom. The thing I love most about you is how you can change my mood from sad to happy, just with a little conversation. I love going places with you like to our friends' weddings, the beach, and walking through the park. I am yours for as long as you want me.",1
"My love, that's exactly what you are. Just want you to know that you mean the world to me and that without you I don't know where I'd be. The past two years have brought us pain and happiness but, most of all, they have brought us closer together. You are my heart, my best friend, and my one true love. I don't know what the future has in store for us, but I know that our love will be able to handle it all.",1
"I love being with you, holding you, and looking into your eyes, just hoping you feel the same about me. I love you so much, words cannot fully express it. Every moment I spend with you is a moment I cherish. I grow deeper in love with you more and more every day, and I do not know what I would do without you now. I long for your hugs and kisses. Sometimes I like to think my love for you is like a great dream, because I don't ever want to wake up and lose that love.I have found both love and friendship with you. We are not just lovers, we are also friends, and that is what makes our relationship so special because the greatest lovers don't always make the best of friends. When you feel that times can't get any worse, I will try my best to always make things better to make you happy, and I will be by your side whenever you need me. I hope I am and always will be in your heart and in your dreams forever. I love you.",1
"A smile comes on my face whenever I think of you. When I see you smile at me in my dreams, I smile back, even when I'm asleep. I love you because you understand me for who I am. I remember the first time it was hard for me to say, ""I love you,"" because I never thought that you could love me back, but then it turned out that we loved each other. Loving you is the greatest gift I have in life. Thank you for giving me your love and respect. I love you!",1
"I just want to tell you how very much I love you, now and forever. You light up my life forever, Sweetheart. I thank God each and every day for our love for each other. I am so very thankful that God blessed me with a husband as wonderful as you are. I am looking forward to next September when we renew our wedding vows to one another. You have always been there for me no matter what the situation was. I love spending my life with you. All your passionate kisses and hugs mean everything to me and always will. Our love will always grow because we love one another so much. You mean everything to me and always will--now and forever.",1
"The first time I heard you say the words, ""I love you,"" it was like I had been taken to Cloud 9, and I haven't come down until now. Right after you uttered those words, I asked myself, ""Do I love him?"" As I looked for an answer, I asked again: ""Have he given me any reason not to?"" No, just more reasons to love you. I then realized that I had already fallen in love with you, and I am so in love with you still.In the past, I had always yearned for someone to love, to cherish, and to take good care of--someone with whom I could share my dreams who would help make them come true. I had always walked around feeling an emptiness that I thought would never get filled, but you filled that hole. I think back to how empty my life was without you, and I am so grateful that you are here now. I have found in you what it means to love. I tell you a hundred times a day, every day, that I love you. Although you return these feelings and love me, too, I don't know if you understand the magnitude of what they mean to me. You may not realize it, but when you do the slightest thing for me, it warms my heart. Each day I fall more in love with you. I love you more and more with each passing day. It eases me to know that, as tomorrow approaches, I will love you more than yesterday, and tomorrow I will love you more than I do today. You are really God's gift to me--His answer to my fervent prayer that I will forever cherish in my heart.You are the most wonderful, kind, compassionate, romantic, smart, sensible, intelligent, talented, thoughtful, congenial, appreciative, loyal, loving, passionate, handsome man I have ever met, and I thank God every day that you are mine! I love you with my whole heart and soul, my whole being, and nothing in this world can take that away! I love you more than I could ever express in words. More than I can understand. You have touched my heart in ways no one could ever comprehend.I hope today turns out to be the day I hoped it would be for us. Today, I'd like to give you this little glass that holds the unrelenting memories of my past that shackles my being. I just have to give this to you and I have to do this for myself, for you, and for us. Today, I give my life to you--my heart, my mind, my body, and my soul. I belong to you now.This may start sounding like a romantic poem. I don't know. I just want to let you know that you are my heart and my soul mate, and that I love you with everything I have and hold. Now, when I look towards the future, I always see you there. Maybe, in this lifetime, you will never know how much I love and cherish you. Your love gives me the feeling that the best is still ahead. I can't wait to spend forever with you.Happy Birthday, Honey! I love you so!",1
"I thought your kiss would be a whisper, but instead it filled me with a deep passion. I thought your touch would cool my skin, but it only awakened burning fires. I thought the joining of our bodies would bring a release, but it only created an insatiable craving.Your presence is an intoxicating elixir. Your eyes are enticing, inviting. What is it about you that draws me closer? What is the secret that makes you irresistible? Why can't I have enough of you?You create awareness in me. You make me whole. There are no consequences when I yield to your touch. I have no regrets. I only have the gift of my love to give to you. You are my heart.",1
"""Forever"" is a hard word to understand. It encompasses all time. It extends beyond what we can possibly know. It extends beyond our own existence. It is, therefore, the only word I can use to describe my love for you, which exceeds anything I can possibly comprehend or describe. You have brought such happiness into my life and have brought me such bliss and affection.I will forever love you. As I sleep, as I work, as I walk, as I breathe, you will always be in my thoughts. You will always be in my heart. You are a gift I will be grateful for every moment of the rest of my life. I thank God for bringing us together. Remember, I am yours forever.",1
"Have you ever been caught in that one moment, that moment when, for the first time, the melody of life's sweet song is played in perfect harmony with your desires? As the chords play on, and as your mind moves with the notes, your body melts into the warmth of your emotions. Immersed in that moment, all that remains are a sea of crimson butterflies, their wings fluttering rhythmically to the beating of your heart. Just then, you wish you could capture that moment in time, for that moment creates a beauty as unique and wondrous as a yellow rose in a garden of violets. You wish that moment to be more than just a moment. More than anything, you wish it to be forever!With you, this moment is my every moment. When we kiss, or sleep, or talk--every hour that we are apart, I am lost--lost in this moment with you.",1
"There have been so many delightful moments in our relationship, and so many special memories are etched in my mind forever. Of course, like all couples, we have had some rough times, some disagreements and obstacles, but the good has far outweighed the bad, and even the hard times have brought us closer together.Of course, it's possible that something could separate us and that we may not always be able to stay together. However, I want you to know that I shall always remember you as the partner who taught me the true meaning of life. I will always remember you with gratitude and deep affection. You mean so much to me now and will forever.",1
"True love begins as a friendship, but then quickly catches fire. It develops into mutual understanding, sharing, and forgiving. It proves to be loyal through both good and bad times. It settles for less than perfection and allows for human weaknesses.True love is content with the present, hopes for the future, and doesn't brood over the past. It's the day-in and day-out chronicle of irritations, problems, compromises, little disappointments, big victories, and mutual efforts toward common goals. If you have true love, it makes up for so many things you lack, but if you don't have it, whatever else you have is just not enough.When we met all those years ago, I soon knew you were the only one for me. Of all the people in this world, now you're the only one I run to for counsel and advice. I whisper your name when I wake up and hope I can see you every day before I dream of you every night. I know the love we enjoy is true love, so I know I will love you for the rest of my life.",1
"I don't know if I tell you this often enough, but I want to start off by telling you how madly, truly, and deeply I am in love with you. I love you so very much, with all my heart and soul, and will, forever and always! You bring so much happiness into my life and have brought so much love into my heart! It is truly a blessing that I found you. I want you to know that with every moment, my love for you grows stronger and deeper.Honey, I never knew I could be this happy. It is the greatest feeling in the world to be this happy and content, and I have found it all with you. No one else has ever made me feel the way you make me feel. Your caress, your kiss, your touch, your words, your understanding ways--everything about you means the world to me and none of this could ever be replaced.Sometimes I feel like I start to bother you, but we seem to overcome all our problems, and we are still together. We have had good times and bad times, but the good ones surely make up for the bad ones. That is what is most important. I pray we will always be together. You are my best friend, my lover, my soul mate, and I will love you forever and ever! I promise you that, and I want you to be my partner for life. Let's have some really good times now and enjoy each and every moment we have together. I love you.",1
"When you came into my life, I wasn't sure how to react. I was so drawn to you and yet so wrapped up in my own narrow vision still that I almost lost you. Thank you for not giving up on me and for having the faith to keep trying to save our relationship. I have never loved anyone as much I love you--so completely, so unconditionally, like never before. When I told you that I would love you forever, I meant it. I will love you always!",1
"There are no words to express the gratitude I feel now that we have fallen in love. You are my life, my heart, my soul. You are my best friend. You are my one true love. The day we met must have been fate because you are my destiny now. I love you more today than I did yesterday, and I will love you more tomorrow than I do today. Loving you is the only thing that makes my life worth living now. I am forever yours.",1
"There are no words to express how I feel about you. I constantly search for the right words, but they all seem to be less than what I truly feel. You are my life, my heart, and my soul. You are my best friend. You are my one true love. I still remember the day we first met. I knew that you were the one I was meant to be with forever. As the years went by, and we drifted apart, I still held onto the memory of you. I thought of you every day, and dreamed of you every night. Just when I thought you had forgotten me, you called and made all my dreams come true again. The sound of your voice on the phone was the sweetest sound I ever heard. That day you called and told me we might have a chance to make it all right again, my heart started beating within my chest, my hand shook holding the receiver, and I could barely breathe. When you came out to see me, and I knew it was meant to be-those were the sweetest days, those memories of the past. It all went by so quickly. I wanted it to last.The day you left, I thought I would die. Then you called again, and I heard your voice on the line. I had to be near you, to hold you again. I needed to show you that you were the best. So I made the decision to tell you how I felt. When you said you felt the same, I felt it was a dream. I packed my stuff and changed my life forever. I never looked back because now you will make me your wife. I am on a cloud, living in a dream, and a few days from now, it will really feel real. I wrote this letter for you to keep and, when you need a reminder of how we felt on those happy days, it will remind you. I've said it before and I'll say it again, words cannot really express how you make me feel. I make this promise to you, my dear: I will always love you the way I did in the beginning. I now look to the future and forget the past, hoping that your love will always be mine and that we can make it last. I love you more today than I did yesterday, and I'll love you more tomorrow more than I do today. With all my heart, I am forever yours.",1
"Ever since you came into my life with this heavenly made gift called ""love,"" I have noticed so many changes in my lonely world. You made me believe again that love comes to those who know and listen to the music of love.You have touched my life in so many ways, like being here for me at a time when I thought all hope was lost. When I was deserted and thought that the world had come to an end, you stood by me through all the rough and difficult times. You made me understand that life is all about appreciation and understanding, but must be appreciated first before there can be understanding, and neither can exist without having experienced love first.I want to make this promise to you, based on the love that you have shown me, and the things you have done to teach me again what hope means. I declare my love for you alone, no one but you, and that is from the bottom of my heart. I promise to be there for you, both in good and in bad times, because you are worth everything to me.I pray the Lord will watch over us till the end of time.",1
"Hope you're doing fine. You know what? I'm so thankful that I've met you because you've changed me a lot. I'm no longer afraid of having a relationship, and that's all because of you. You've shown me how to love and to be loved, and I will never forget each little thing that you have done for me.I really love to see you smiling. Every time that I talk to you, and every time that I see you, you're always carrying those lovely smiles of yours on your face, and I can't hesitate to smile back.All these years, I have been saving my feelings for you and, after all these years, no one even knew about it. It's hard for me to hide it, but I must! Now that I know that I am just your friend, I will always be just that. I came to the decision that I must forget wanting you and learn to be your friend.I do hope that someday you can still think of me as a friend who once loved you and respected you. Always remember that I will still be here for you, as your friend. Although I would rather be your one true love, I am content to be your friend. I do hope that you've found real happiness in your life, but if not, I'm still here, waiting for you. I will always love you.",1
"I never thought you would be back. It never occurred to me that I would even see you again. But there you were, talking and laughing to me and being comfortable, as if nothing had happened two years ago. Why in the world have we even met again?I don't want to ask for anything more than this. I just want this to last, even if it will result in just being friends. Just being in touch with you again, without promises, is more than enough. Remaining friends is enough for me to feel certain that I will have a connection with you again. I will know what is happening in your life, and you will know what is happening in mine. We are enjoying a good relationship again, and that is all that I need right now.",1
"With thirty years almost upon us, I have to tell you about my feelings. I have loved you for all time, and even before. I shall feel the kiss, the embrace, the way I see your face, the winds and the storms and the seasons change. I shall see your thoughts showing on the passing waves of your heart's feelings. With each passing year, I shall love thee with all I am. I love you, Darling. Happy anniversary!",1
"I am so thankful I met you and that we are together now. I have loved you from the first time I heard you speak and from the first time you looked into my eyes. Right now we are having some problems with our relationship, but I know that together we will be strong and will overcome everything and everybody that tries to get in our way. Over the last few months, I kept falling in love with you more and more with each passing day. Thank you for teaching me to be strong and to be a better person. I hope we last forever and have a family someday, because you are the person I want to share my whole life with.",1
"When I first talked to you on the phone, I knew you were someone special. Now, whenever I am not with you, I miss you so much. Every second of my life, I know I have found someone special. I will always be grateful for your sweetness, and I'm happy now just to have you in my life.Let's continue as we are and stay true to one another. That first phone call was not the last, and we are getting to know one another better through long talks and long walks.",1
"I love you because I have never been loved by anyone the way you love me. I feel like a complete woman now. I love your patient manner, your generous nature, and your warm embrace--particularly the way you hold me when we fall asleep. When you hold me, I feel that nothing can harm me. I love your genuine kindness, your eyes, and your lips. I love your sense of self-worth, your calming nature, your social ability, your variety of talents, your smooth back and strong arms. For some reason, though, you have become distant lately, but I hope the strength of our relationship will reunite us soon. I miss you terribly and feel incomplete without you. Please come back soon. I love you.",1
"You have given me your love, your heart, and your soul. I want to give you my life, my strength, and my spirit. Lean on me, and I will be your shelter from life's troubles. Should you ever feel sad, come to me, and I will help you smile. Should you ever feel anger, bring it to me, and I will help you find the brighter side of what happened. If you should feel lost or afraid, come to me, and let me lead you home to my heart again. From this night forward, I will love you with all that I am or ever can be, for without you I am nothing.You are the breadth of my universe. You are the sun and the light that guides me through the darkest of times. You are my hope when all seems lost, and you are everything I could ever dream of. You are my heart, my soul, and my spirit. You are all these things, and I am devoted to you and always will be. I love you and give you my all.",1
"Since you have welcomed me into your life, I have never known such unconditional love. You are truly a gift from God and I give thanks every day that you are a part of my life. You have made my life complete.There was a time that I used to cry and tell my friends that I would die alone if I ever lost you! What a terrible thought, but it is true. I had no idea what God had in mind for me. I can never express how I feel with words. When we make love I really think we are cementing our love. It is truly the most intimate way I know to express my love. Mere words are not nearly enough. Actions, in this case, speak volumes. I will love you with all my heart, mind, soul, and body--forever and a day.You've shown me what real love is; like I have never known before, but only dreamed of knowing. My dream of all dreams has finally come true. I guess it's true. Good things do come to those who wait!",1
"Now that our relationship is getting serious, I want to tell you that I feel blessed just to know you and to be in your life. When I think about us planning our life together, I believe that God has given me a wonderful gift! I don't say I deserve it, but I do say that I am happy to plan our future together.My heart is yours, so take care of it and tread lightly. I wish I could be with you now as you face so many struggles, but know that I am there in spirit and am praying for everything to work out for you. No matter where this life will take us, together or not, know that you will always be in my heart and be ""my one and only.""",1
"We've spent so many memorable times together this year. Our love for each other grows each day. I don't know if I told you this already, but I really love everything about you. The way you hold me, the way we walk hand-in-hand, the way you lean your head upon my shoulder--every little thing you do makes me love you even more. I'm just so glad that I found someone like you; someone who's always there to make me happy, to make me smile, to brighten up my day. I feel that you're really the only one that I want to be with forever. I just want to share more happy memories with you. You know that I will love you forever and, whenever you need me, I'll always be there for you because I truly love you.",1
"I once read in a book that good memories are like jewels. Each memory is essentially unique, and each one is collected one by one. Eventually, you look back and discover that you've formed a vibrant, colorful, and priceless piece of jewelry.We are working on that piece of jewelry. Already, we have created so many breathtaking memories together, memories that we will always treasure. When we are watching our children grow, when they experience their first love, and when we grow old together, we will always have these memories of our love. We will always be able to think back on them and smile at all the joys we've shared together.Thank you for the memories we have had and for the memories we will yet create. Thank you for being there for me, loving me, and helping to build a new life with me.I will love you always.",1
"As the old year ends and the new year begins, take all that I have to offer to you and hold it dear to you. Keep my heart safe, as I will keep your heart safe. From now until this new year ends, we will know that our hearts are joined. You are mine, and I am yours. Together we are one, and I will love you forever. Happy New Year!",1
"I am crazy about you. I am head over heels crazy about you! After such a short time, we have grown so close and intimate. The intensity of my feelings makes it hard for me to even remember what my life was like before I met you.So here I am, heart and soul, confessing to you how I feel. I have never in my life met someone like you before--someone so kind and strong and brave! I have never in my life with anyone felt so warm and complete. You are clearly the match for my soul. No matter what happens, you have changed my life, and I will be forever yours. From now until my last breath, I will always be there for you. I will always love you.",1
"After almost 41 years of marriage, I miss you as if we were newlyweds. I love you and can't wait till these three weeks apart will be over. I think of the passionate love-making awaiting both of us when I return. It will be like a second honeymoon to embrace you and make passionate love to you once again.I love you, I need you, and I want you as if I had just fallen in love with you for the first time. Absence does in fact make the heart grow fonder.",1
"It truly seems like I've known you forever, and I really can't imagine life without you anymore. There will be no looking back, no second thoughts, and no regrets. I love you and only you, and my love grows stronger every day. We know that life can hit us with events that take us totally by surprise. I want you to know that your capacity for love, caring, and understanding has taken me by surprise, and it still never ceases to amaze me! I've truly been blessed to find you, and now I will never let you go!",1
"Words can become a burden, when it is you that I am trying to express my love to. You see, it is a very deep, heart-felt love! One that only the right words can do justice to.You lighten my day regardless of what the day may be. If it is raining, the very thought of you turns the raindrops into drops of love that saturates my very soul with the assurance that I will never have to be without your love again.Am I dreaming? Is it real? These are the questions that I asked myself when I awaken from the experience of your love for me. Then I realize that it is real. You do love me and I do love you! What joy! That is something that I never had before, and when it is threatened, my body goes through spasms or something. I experience pains like I never thought possible. The fact is, I love you with a heart-felt love that is beyond verbal expression. For you give me joy.When I touch your hands it becomes an experience that can only be compared with the ecstasy of love's climax. Kissing your lips takes me to places that people only experience in fantasies. What is it that you do to me? I'll tell you. You give me love, the kind of love that can't be bought or haphazardly found. It is the kind of love that can only just happen once in a lifetime with someone as unique as you are.So, while I know that it would be beneath what I really and truly feel in my heart for you, just let me express my heart-felt love for you by merely saying, I love you.",1
"The more I think of how and when you came into my life, the more I realize that I can give no one credit but God. You are truly heaven-sent. It was so pure, so natural, and so right. All the things I prayed for came into my life through you. Different things you said--and still say--are things that were in my heart that I've never said to anyone but God in my prayers.You brought out the best in me. You've shown me what real love is and how to love. You treat me with such royalty, like a precious gem. You listen to me, and you believe in me. You always know what to say, when to say it, and how to say it at the right moment and at the right time.The love you have for me and for our children builds up my faith that because of God's timing, we have become a happy family. I love you with an unconditional love. It will never stop.",1
"I just want to let you know how much I love all that you are and all that you still can become. Without a doubt, you provide me with a stable force and, for the first time in my life, I have someone to believe in. You truly are my love, my soul mate, and my best friend. You've seen me at my worst and still take me as I am. I thank God for you every day because I know you are heaven sent; you are my guardian angel. The years will be a test, but nothing will keep me from loving you or from being by your side. I love you more than you know. You are my entire world.",1
"I don't know why you love me. I don't deserve your love, kindness, and never-ending forgiveness. When I mess up, you take the blame for me. When I yell at you, and it's really something I did, you apologize. When life gets difficult and I don't think I can take it anymore, I just sit and cry, but you tell me it's going to be okay. When I think my problems are hopeless, you instill in me hope in tomorrow.I don't know why you put up with me, but I thank you for everything you do for me. I love you more than you know, and more than I could show you or express in words. I don't think I could live without you now. Although things are getting harder, you give me the strength and assurance that one day we will always be together.I trust you with all my heart, and believe everything you tell me. I'm sorry for all the miserable things I throw your way, assuming so many things, jumping to conclusions without thinking clearly. I'm sorry I just start taking my pain out on you. You treat me better than I could hope for, and I'm so grateful that you're mine. God sent you to me because He knew I needed your strength and support. You're wonderful; you're everything to me. I'll love you forever.",1
"It has been a long time since we met, don't you think? I can't believe how long I loved you and still contained my love!Your beautiful eyes and the sweet smile you gave me melted my heart away. I wish I could have given your smooth cheeks a kiss as soon as I met you. Now, whenever I see your face, my knees go weak, my heart throbs when I feel you near me. Your body is perfection, but it wouldn't matter to me anyway.I loved the way you looked at me yesterday. Thank you for the smile you gave me. My mouth dropped open, but I would have stuttered if I had tried to speak. I couldn't say anything; I just stared at your natural beauty. I wish I could have had the courage to do so because you're the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I have been praying to find someone like you for several years now, and I hope I'll be able to talk to you soon. I just don't have the courage right now.I hope we could go out together one day, and I could pour out my feelings to you. Even if you don't love me, I'll always wait for you and hope. No matter what, you are in my heart, no matter what happens. I hope that some day I'll be able to hold you in my arms and tell you that I love you. I will always love you--and that's a promise!",1
"I can remember our first moments together as though they were just yesterday. I can remember the words you spoke and the tender tone of your voice. I can even remember the way your eyes looked at me so lovingly. In those moments, I felt released into a world of hope and possibility, and I knew we were right for each other.The months since that meeting have been the richest and most rewarding of my life. You have impacted my world in every way imaginable, and all I think about now is how great our future could be and how many beautiful moments we could have together. I wish I could find words to express my many feelings for you. In the end, though, I just want you to know that I need you and love you so much. I just hope you feel the same.",1
"The love I feel for you is stronger than I could ever describe. You are a miracle to me--every part of you feels like a miracle. Your eyes glow with your tenderness and attention. Your smile casts a spell. Your kisses intoxicate me and fill me with yearning. Your scent--there's nothing in the world quite as rich and inviting!I love everything about you. With each new day, with each new word from your mouth, and with each new touch of your embrace, I fall further and further in love with you. There's no turning back for me. I am yours and yours alone--now and always.",1
"I love you so much! You have been so great to me. Through thick and thin you were always there. It means a lot to me that you are my husband and the father of our beautiful little child. I couldn't have asked for better. You are beautiful, too, and you are beautiful in every single way. I know that I don't always say it, but I look forward to our lifetime together. It is and has been so great already. I love you, Baby. I don't know if you really understand how much!",1
Re: Just to Say I Love YouThis is my way of trying to tell you how much I love you. I can't really find the words to explain the way I feel when I hear your voice or when I see your face. All I can say is that I like that feeling because it is a feeling of pure happiness!So I write this just to tell you now that I love you and always will.,1
"I have so much to tell you. I want you know that I love the way you treat me, the way you make me feel, the way you embrace me, and the way you talk to me. I love the way you look at me, the way you kiss me, the way you touch me, and the way you hold my hand.I can't find words for it all, but I am so much in love with you. Whatever we do together, wherever we are, I feel your care and compassion. I adore your heart and soul.I have to let you know, Baby--I love you.",1
"You are everything to me. When I met you at your uncle's birthday party that special night, I had no idea that you would love me as much as I would love you. As soon as I laid eyes on you, I knew that I had made eye contact with one of heaven's angels.When you invited me over to your place to watch a movie, I was frozen to the spot. Just to hear your voice made my heart melt. Your voice is the sweetest sound I ever heard. No other sound in this world could ever be so sweet. Your smile is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen--even more beautiful than a rose blooming or the sun setting over the mountains. When I hug you, I know that you care by the way your heart beats against mine.When I am with you, the world and its troubles just fade away. When I have a bad day, I know you are there for me. I'll do anything to try to make you smile when you are having a bad day, too. I'll kiss your soft, sweet lips and look into those beautiful eyes and try to make them sparkle with happiness. I was about to give up all hope of finding love until I laid eyes on you.I always thought love was just a word people say to talk discouraged souls into dating again. I was wrong, though, because without you I would not know love was real. I realize now that you are my reason for getting up in the morning. God must have put me on this earth just to be with you. And I thank Him every night for sending you to me. Without you I think I would be still be lying in a pile of my own troubles.There is no mountain that reaches higher than my love for you. No river is deeper than the depth of my love. My love stretches farther than all the oceans in the world. It is the kind of love most people only dream about. All the money in the world or all the possessions in the world could never be more important to me than you are. You are my heart and soul. You are everything to me..When I hear your voice, my heart skips a beat. Ever since we met, my heart beats more rapidly. Just for you to be mine and be with you is more than I could ask for. All my life I thought perfect love was only a dream but, now that I found you, I know it can be real.I hope that we can be together forever because without you, I will be nothing. Before you, I never thought highly of myself. I need to have your love, just to be all that I can be. You hold the key to my heart and keep me involved in life. Without you I am nothing.No one could ever mean as much to me as you do. I love you more than life itself; you are my everything.",1
"Hey, Sweetie, I just wanted you to know that I am the luckiest woman in the world to be with you. I have never been as happy in my life as I am now when I'm with you. You mean the whole world to me, and I can't wait for the day when the whole world will know about the love I have for you. I want nothing more than to be a wonderful wife to you and the perfect mother to our children.",1
"We met almost four years ago, and my life hasn't been the same since. You began as my friend, someone I could talk to, laugh with, someone who was always there for me, even when there were gaps because one of us had left for a while. Somewhere in the past 2 ' years, though, I fell in love with you and, ever since then, I've always been waiting here for you, but waiting for you to realize I am here, and that all you have to do is ask, and I'd be there with you. Instead, I sit back and watch you become unhappy because you are alone, all because the one you love now can't--or won't do--something to make you happy.We've not talked for a long while now, so I'm afraid I've lost you and honestly don't know how I'm going to handle losing you. I cannot bear thinking of a life without you in it. I know there is going to come a time--and my heart is telling me it's now--that I'm going to have to say goodbye to you, but I cannot bring myself to do it. Since I've fallen in love with you, I've tried to get over how I feel about you, but I just can't. It always come back to hoping you will realize my love for you and fall in love with me too, if only you'd give us a chance. I love you and will always be here if you need me, just don't make me say goodbye.",1
"I know that you probably don't feel much loved by me right now, but I want you to know that I do love you very much. You are my reason for everything. I look at you and I feel like a teenager in love for the first time. The way you talk, the way you walk, and the way you hold me makes my knees weak. I want you to know that no matter how many rough times we go through, that feeling is always there, and I will always wonder what I did to make you love me. Why would such a wonderful guy love me? I don't know, but I am so thankful and proud that you do.",1
"It's been over a year now, and somehow we've made it! No matter what mistakes either one of us have made, you, at least, were determined to keep our love alive. I'll never be able to thank you enough for that. You are the reason I still live, love, and laugh! You mean everything to me.Sometimes you ask me why I love you, but I don't answer. I know you must believe that it is because I really don't love you or because I can't think of a reason. No, it's just that when you ask me, I don't know where to start. The thought leaves me breathless. Our love means the world to me, and I do love you.",1
"No one could ever realize how safe I feel in your arms or just when I'm around you. I know that you will always make me feel safe. When I am in your arms, I just melt away. When I hear your voice, then I know you are close by. If something threatens me, I know you will protect me. I feel so safe around you, and I have never felt like this before. I love you, and I want to be with you for the rest of my life.",1
"Hey, my love! I never thought I'd be where I am today. Looking into your eyes is something I look forward to every day when I wake up. Just knowing you're in my life puts my mind at ease. I develop a smile upon my face every time I think of you. We've been best friends for a long time, but I feel that we've gotten closer. I love holding you in my arms, hearing your voice, seeing you laugh, and just being anywhere with you is incredible each and every time. I do believe we're soul mates, because even though I don't speak to you during the day, I still feel like you're nearby. You'll always be in my life and in my heart. I'll never stop loving you!",1
"Before I met you, my life was such confusion and a maze. I felt alone and without a purpose, like a broken arrow sailing aimlessly through the air. I felt that the commotion and noise of the world would always overwhelm me, and that I was bound to struggle through life as through a series of obstacles.But then you walked into my life and everything changed. You helped me find my way again. The world finally slowed down, the noise and commotion receded, and my heart began to beat stronger than ever before.You are my light. You are my fortune. With you, each moment of each day is more precious than words can express. What we have together is more wonderful than anything I could have imagined.When I count my blessings, I count you twice. I love you with all my heart and soul.",1
"For so long, I felt that something was missing in my life. I felt incomplete, and I didn't understand what could fill that void within me. Now I understand, and now it's clear. You were the missing piece of the puzzle. You were the completion I was longing to find, and I am so happy to have found you.You've become my lover and my best friend. You've become all that I could have wanted. I trust you, and I care about you. It brings me such comfort and joy to think of how much you love and trust me as well. Everything seems right when we're together. Everything makes sense. Thank you for changing my life!Blessings, I count you twice. I love you with all my heart and soul.",1
"I thank heaven I found you, because I know I would be lost without you. My love is true, and I am so thankful that I found you. I don't know why heaven sent you--perhaps to help, love, cherish, and guide me. Darling, you will always have my full attention and be the only person I will truly love. I hope you will always love me, too.",1
"I need to let you know that I'm so in love with you, and you are a very special man to me. I am so thankful that you have come into my life. You've given me more in three months than anyone in my life has before, so please believe what I feel for you is real. You are a very understanding and patient man.I know I have a hard time expressing myself to you. I'm sorry for the crazy things I say and for the way I behave sometimes. But all I ever ask of you is to keep loving me and continue being my man and, in return, I'll never stop loving you. I owe everything to you, because I would not know what it feels like to be loved if it wasn't for you. So, with everything I have inside me, I want you to know that I will be honest, loving, caring, and always true to you. I will never let you down. And I hope that you will be honest, faithful, and true. Let's never make one another blue.",1
"I will love you forever, and I keep on believing that someday I will be able to love you even more as time goes by. I don't know what to say, because I have a lot. If you ever feel the same as I do, then I would be completely glad for the both of us. Nothing can change my love for you, and you will always be the love of my life--forever. I keep on believing.I will always keep a special place for you in my heart. No matter where I go, I carry you with me. I'm just hoping that you feel the same way that I do. Please remember that I love you!",1
"I can't believe it started over one little e-mail. Who would have ever thought I could have met my soul mate through the Internet--definitely not me! From the first time I saw you, I knew I was going to marry you. You make me feel so special, so loved. I have never known a love like this in all my life, and it's the only love I ever want to know. It's been six great months. You are my best friend and my only lover, Baby. You complete me. I will always love you, no matter what happens next!",1
I never thought that I would wake up one morning and realize that I had fallen in love. Every day I look at you and it makes me happier and happier to know that I can spend the rest of my life with you. I know I will never have to worry about losing you and know that you will never leave me. I know it every time I look in your eyes. I love you.,1
"Hey, Baby Girl, I was just sitting here thinking about how much I love you. I love you so much that if I tried to really write how much I love you, I would be constantly writing for the rest of my life.You bring out so much in me that I'm just beginning to see. It's like when we are together, the rest of the world disappears, and nothing else matters but us. I hope I feel this way forever. I want to spend the rest of my life loving you with everything I have to give. Sometimes I feel like I don't deserve someone as loving as you are. Do you know how long I have waited to have someone like you in my life?It wasn't luck that brought us together. You are a blessing to me and I wouldn't trade the way I feel about you for anything in this world. You are the reason why I smile. You are the first thing on my mind when I wake up every morning, and you are the last thing I think about every night before I close my eyes, but our time together doesn't end there because you are the only thing I dream about. I really do want to spend the rest of my life with you if you will allow me to. Nothing is too much to give you. I feel that if you're not happy, then the world needs to stop until you are!Baby, I just want to thank you for loving me like you do, and I am forever in your debt, just for you being good to me. You know, it is strange how I had to go through so many bad situations before you came into my life. I guess it really is true when they say good things come to those who wait because I've waited for someone like you all my life, and you really are the best thing that has ever happened to me.I just want you to know that I love you so much, and I want to be with you till death do us part! I love you, Baby Girl!I Will Keep Waiting For YouI sometimes wonder what you're doing, or whether you are thinking of me, like I'm thinking of you. I have been thinking of you for 20 years, since the day I was born, really.You have been elusive to me in so many ways but, because none of my objects of infatuation turned out to be you, I feel as if life sometimes may have fooled me, yet I know you are out there. I mean, how could I have seen your face and still overlooked you? Or how could I have heard your voice utter words and not have found anyone that sounded like you? Are you in the stars every time I look up? Of course you are. You are the clouds in the skies, the songs the bird sing every morning. You are everywhere, really. I know you are real. I just constantly wonder why I have not found you yet.Why haven't I been able to say all that I want, show you all that I am, and give you all I have now? Why is time making us wait so long? We don't know, because this is a factor beyond our control. I will always love you, Darling, and when we finally find each other, it will be God's greatest reward.So, wherever you are, know that I love you and you will be the one that lurked passionately in my dreams. Know that I am always longing for you and your presence. Know that you will always be everything to me. Even though I have not yet met you yet, I love you, my spirit lover.",1
"Too many days go by without my saying how incredibly fortunate I feel to be with you--but it's true. When we're together, my life takes on new meaning and new freshness. Each morning, each night, and each moment beside you contains all the beauty and vibrancy I could ever hope for.Thank you for filling my days with love, and for making my toes squirm and my heart flutter. Thank you for always listening to me, for sharing your thoughts with me, for supporting me, and for giving me the chance to support you. Thank you for enriching every aspect of my life, and for continually inspiring me to do better and to be a better person.I love you more than words can say.",1
"When I try to describe your beauty, your smile, your kind heart, I find that my words only begin to scratch the surface of my love for you. You are too amazing, too much of a wonder for language to describe. When we are together, and with each gesture you make, and each word that you utter, I realize, more and more, how special and caring you are, and how lucky I am to be with you. When we are not together, the very thought of you brings me more fully to life.Thank you for being there for me. Thank you for loving me and letting me love you. You are a blessing to me!",1
"How can I express my feelings when those feelings take my breath away? How can I measure my love for you when that love compares to nothing else, and when that love exceeds all categories and all expectations? No words can express these realities. No words can express my love for you because you are indescribable, and my love for you is immeasurable.Simply looking into your eyes sends me through a whirlwind of intense emotions. Just one brief smile from you fills my life with radiance and joy. Until the day I met you, I had never before felt so full of hope and passion. I want you to know, I am forever grateful to be with you. You have given me a heart full of love and days full of laughter, and I will give myself to you always.",1
"Hello, my future spouse! You don't know how much I love you. You are the best friend anyone could ever ask for. Whenever I have a problem and need any comfort, you are always there for me. You are the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. You probably don't know just how much I appreciate, admire, trust, respect, and over-all love you. I know you are the only one for me.Being away from you is so hard now. I want to be with you this moment, even as I write to you. When I think of this separation as a test, then I can deal with it. If this is what it takes to eventually be with you, then I can go through it.I want to thank you for coming into my life. You took me by surprise. I didn't think that I could be so lucky as to find you, but now that I have, I don't ever want to let go. You have taught me the true meaning of love. You have brought me more love, joy, and happiness than anyone has ever shown me. I have so much joy in my life now, and I owe it all to you. I love you so much! You and I have shared so much together already, and we have been through so much already that you have become an essential part of my life. I couldn't ever let you go now.I love you because you bring out the best in me. I love your terrific sense of humor. Every time I look at you, my heart skips a beat. You're the only one who holds the key to my heart. You always say what I need to hear. Love is just what you mean to me, and you mean everything. I doubt if either one of us thought we could have met someone on the Internet and fall in love the way we did, but it happened, and I have no regrets. In fact, it is the best thing that ever happened to me, and I am very grateful. Words could not express how much joy you have brought me.I am writing this to you now to let you know I will never forget the day we crossed paths. Over and over I replay in my mind our online chat and then our first telephone conversation! You make me feel so happy and complete. If I hadn't met you, I know I'd still be searching for someone like you. Although I don't say it as often I should, I am telling you now that I want you, I need you, and I love you.Thank you for all the beautiful e-mails you have sent me. You are my best friend, my lover, and my soul mate all in one. We have both gone through so much in our lives. We've both been hurt and have lost trust in others, but I'm glad you've given me another chance as I've given you one. I just ask you to love me as I am and not to hurt me. I want you to know that I won't hurt you.From this moment on, we have each other and can enjoy being in each other's arms. When I say I love you, I truly mean it. Of all the people in this world, you're the only one I run to now. Your name was inscribed in my heart before I ever knew it belonged to you. From the moment we met all those years ago, I knew you were the one. I whisper your name every morning when I wake up and whenever I think of you. I am who I am now because of you, and without you I would start to fall apart. You have given me a new outlook on the world and, through the times when darkness covered it, you were always the light.",1
"I want you to know how much I love you. We have been through so much these past few months, but our love has always come out on top. You mean so much to me, and I want so much to make you as happy as you make me. Each passing day has me falling more in love with you. You can do the slightest thing and it warms me. Most of the time you don't even realize it. You are always in my thoughts and in my heart. I never knew that love could be so wonderful until I met you. You have given me a new perspective on so many things. I will always treasure our love and keep it safe. I love you, Baby.",1
"I don't know where to start to tell you all the incredible things my heart is feeling. I don't want my letter to say all the usual things someone will say when they're in love. I am just so happy to finally find someone who truly loves me, who really cares, and not just another person who comes into my life to play with my heart for a little while, and then leave. I want to thank you for being my friend. You mean everything to me. I want to tell you I love you, and I want to make you happy always. Thank you for giving me what no one has ever been able to give me before--you!",1
"Remember those long nights on the phone when we were teenagers? I do. I will never forget how wonderful they all were. Now that we have been getting back to the ""good old times,"" I can't help but remember things such as when you would play your guitar over the phone and sing to me.Deep down I have always loved you, and I always will. Ever since I met you in the 6th Grade you have been a blessing. Now I just want to say that no matter what, I will always love you. You are my inspiration, my hope, my love, and I promise to always have a place for you in my heart. I love you.",1
"I need not explain how we met, because you walked the exact same way toward me as I walked to find you. I need not tell you how much I love you, because we speak the same language. I need not explain to you the depths of our love, because you have sat with me in the center of its depths. I need not tell you about the freedom of what we say, because we are not chained by words. I need not tell you about the tenderness of touch, because we have both held each other's hands and felt butterflies in our hearts. I need not tell you about the magic of a whisper, because we have listened with our souls. No one needed to explain to us what darkness felt like, because we were lost in it before. No one needed to teach us how it felt to step into the light, because we both had to shut our eyes when the bright light of love surrounded us. I need not tell you about the power of peace, because we've been lovers in each other's worlds of sand, where colors speak with words. I need not tell you about the importance of a single second now, either, because we have tasted the sweetness of a heavenly moment and the bitterness of when it's not long enough. I need not tell you how hearts can break and how they are mended, because we mended each other's broken hearts when we first met.I need not tell you about fear, because we have seen it move through us in many forms and through many layers. I need not tell you how it moves or how long it stays, because we don't always know. I need not tell you about longing, because we have heard its screams in the dead of the night. I need not tell you about stillness, because in the stillness we've known has been the deepest, most powerful silence. I need not tell you about power, because we know that power is not in strength, but in truth and in knowing, but most of all in loving. I need not tell you about our love because true love is what has grown from the inside and finally has shown in each other's eyes.Nobody needs to tell us anything now, because we know everything! Love has filled our hearts with all there is to know and learn. All I pray is that time and life will bring you back to me--soon.",1
"Words cannot describe what goes through my mind when I think of you! It boggles my mind how I can think of someone almost every single second, minute, and hour of every day!You are truly amazing in every good way. There was a time when I just didn't think it was possible for me to love again the way I love you and, yet, we are not together! How can that be?I sit here and ask myself how it is possible that two people who care so much about one another as we do cannot be together! I love you and adore you! I feel we understand and know each other so well--maybe too well sometimes! Our situation is starting to get out of control--all the secrets, all the lies, all the hurting each other!I ask myself if this is all worth it, and sometimes I just want to give in and say ""enough is enough"" and let go, but that's easier said than done. I think of all the good times and all the good in you, and all the beautiful memories in this relationship! People say if two people truly love one another, then they should be able to overcome anything!Sometimes I feel it's only me who has the true love, and yours is some sort of fantasy love. I have put my heart and soul into the past nine months of my life with you. I feel all the effort I have put in this has got to get me somewhere! Then there are days that I just want to let go and say ""enough is enough"" again. But it's easy to propose impossible solutions!You're my baby, you're my love, you're my best friend, you're everything to me right now, so why, tell me why, why is it so hard to just move on? It seems like every time I feel that we are getting somewhere, something happens or someone comes back to cause us problems again. Then I'm right back to square one! It just isn't right. I know you don't want to be with anyone else right now, but I'm not so sure about that! You say that you don't have anybody else in your life, but I think you do! I think there is someone out there getting the time that belongs to me. You say you love me truly and want me to believe you. Well it's hard to do that when I feel you're spending time with someone else.I have already proven my love to you. You know that I'm not with anyone else. I can't be, until I figure out everything about you and me, and everything we have or don't have! I don't want to fight, I don't want to hide, and I don't want to lie! I want to be real! I want us to be honest with each other!Please help me to understand where I stand! You can be so confusing sometimes with your actions and words! This situation is driving me crazy when it really should be giving me unconditional happiness! I decided to stay with you, so I shouldn't complain, but I wouldn't stay if I didn't feel--or you didn't make me feel--there is enough reason to! That's why it's so hard to decide to go! Ultimately a decision has to be made, though.Friendship can remain, but are you ready to give up love? Because if your words still sound real to me when you say, ""I love you,"" then there is no way I can leave you. I'm here because I want to be here, but even a girl in love can handle only so much. Remember, actions speak louder than words! I have not only told you, but showed you how much I love you, too. Sooner or later something has to give. You tell me what that is! You're my one true love, and I will always love you, whether we're together or not!",1
"Each night before I fall asleep, your sweet voice echoes in my mind. As I rest my head on my pillow, the memory of your smile comforts my soul, and I want you to know that you and you alone have made me whole. Without you I would simply be surviving, but with you I am living my life to its fullest now. Because of your love, my spirit has been rejuvenated.Because of you, simple pleasures in life bring me so much joy that it is hard to find words to describe them. A walk in the park becomes a reality--based metaphor because of our journey together, hand-in-hand, for time eternal.The differences between you and me are very few, yet they are there. But we accept those differences, embracing them because they have become part of the things we love about each other. Even in our bad moods and regardless of the irritations we find in daily life, we manage to make each other laugh. Our joking together may seem silly to other people, but it always makes us chuckle and laugh. The sound of your laughter warms my heart and is music to my ears. I believe we could survive anywhere and overcome anything as long as we were together!Love is not a job, love simply is. Unconditional love is what I offer you and, when I'm with you, I feel like I receive the same in return. You are my heart of hearts, my soul mate, my friend, my lover, and my partner for life. Thank you for being there, for loving me, and for giving me everything that my heart has ever wanted. I love you now and always will.",1
"I am sitting here, thinking about you, thinking about all the things we've talked about, all the things we've said to each other, thinking about the many times we said, ""I love you"" to each other. Those three words have never lost their value, even though we've said them more than a hundred times to one another. I know you are somewhere on the other side of the world, thinking about me too. Wherever you are, I walk by your side. When you go to bed, I am laying down with you. When you sit down to eat, I sit next to you, too. When you are combing your hair, I am there kissing and stroking it, smelling the shampoo you use. I am so in love with you--and I can even feel you here beside me, holding me, saying, ""Love, come with me."" I would come with you anywhere without hesitation.My love, all I am saying now is that I am so happy to have found you. You mean everything to me. You are my earth, my water, my sun, and my moon. You are everything that gives life in my world, everything that maintains life around me. Having you with me is like being reborn. Before you, I was dead. I was like a zombie wandering around with no destination, or a robot that people commanded. I didn't have a life with any meaning. Now I have you, and all I want to do is be with you and feel you near me. I want you to know that you are wanted--how much? That is not something I can describe in words. I can't wait until I can kiss you, hold you, and just show you how much you are wanted. We will be together soon. It will warm my heart just to look in your beautiful green eyes again. I love you so much!",1
"I have never encountered someone as radiant, or as beautiful, and as kind as you are. The mere sight of you, the simple hint of your voice, quickens my pulse and awakens hope and wonder in me. I never imagined someone could be so open or so caring. Every day, I feel grateful for just having met you.You are full of life. Your personality is so vibrant and unique. I want to discover everything there is to understand about you. In truth, I can no longer envision my life without you. Although our paths are new and our tracks are fresh, our first steps together have reassured me of one thing: I wish to have you next to me always. I wish to spend my life with you.",1
"You mean everything to me. Thank you for loving me the way no one else can. You understand me and know how to make things just right. You will never know just how much I love you, but I will spend the rest of my days trying to show you. You saved me from the worst of my fears, and you were always there for me. Fighting is never an issue with you, and making love is always as sweet as the first time. No matter what, there will never be anyone else for me, and I will always keep you warm with my love. I love you and will for all eternity. Thank you, Baby!",1
"I knew you were someone special from the moment I met you. I knew by the way you looked at me, talked to me, and were always there for me. I was afraid to love again--afraid of the pain it might bring. But in a short time, you showed me that real love wasn't painful or deceitful. You showed me that I deserved to be loved and to be happy. You gave new meaning to my life, and I can never thank you enough for that! You truly are a godsend to me!For all you've done for me, I promise to always be there for you, cherish you, and love you whole-heartedly. I promise to be a loyal and loving spouse for the rest of my days. I promise to always love you!",1
"No day goes by without my thinking of you. You are such a great person that I find it hard to believe that you were single for such a long time. It is not easy to be a single Dad, but you do a good job and your children are happy. Each time that I see you, I find you more attractive and more appealing. Not only do your outward looks appeal to me, but I am attracted to you because you have a wonderful sense of humor, and your children seem to admire you and love you. They certainly appear to know that their Dad loves them.Are you truly happy being single now? You say that you are afraid of a commitment. I can understand that because I am, too. We have seen one another a good many times now, and I am beginning to be less afraid of a commitment. I feel that I want a permanent relationship with you, because we have a good time together, and I hate to say ""goodbye"" at the end of the evening. But I look forward to the new plans we make, because we need to see each other again.I guess I am saying that I wish you were mine. I don't want to be without you or have to go home and stare at empty walls. I am asking you to think about marriage. I love your children and I promise to treat them as though they were my own. I promise to love, honor, and cherish you. Will you be mine? That would make me so happy. That's because I love you so much. Please be mine.",1
"If only I had known you were out there, then I would have been searching for you long before I had actually met you. If only I had known there was someone like you who would give me all their love, I would have done anything and everything in my power to find you sooner. But now that I have found you, I'll never let you go. Because I have found you, all my hopes and dreams have come true! I love you with all my heart!",1
"If only I had known that you were out there, then I would have been searching for love long before I found you. If only I had known there was someone out there like you, I would have searched the ends of the earth. If I had known that I would meet someone who could give me everything, who would do anything for me, and who would give me all their love--I would have done anything and everything in my power to find true love sooner. But now that I have found you, I will never let you go!I hope that you and I will always feel satisfied with our love for each other. I know there could never be anyone else for me but you.",1
"I know sometimes it seems that I don't care, but if only you knew the love that I have for you. It's what wakes me up in the morning; it's the energy that makes life worth living. If only you knew how much it hurts me to see you hurt, and it hurts even worse to know that I'm the one that caused you pain. I'm sorry. There are no reasons or excuses as to why I do the things I do, but if only you knew how much I don't mean them. I told you once before that I can't help the fact that I'm stingy and that I only want your love for myself. It would kill me to know that someone else is receiving what I thought was only meant for me. Though you may have heard this before, and I may have said it before, too, but I can't live my life completely without you in it anymore. When God gave me you, he gave me everything I needed. You're all that I long for; you're all I ever wanted. If I could change anything about this relationship, it would only be that we weren't always married. I love you with all my heart and, like I said before in the words of our favorite singer, ""I will never ever leave you.""",1
"If only we had met another time in our lives. Perhaps when you were more ready to settle down and be happy. I do understand that there was a lot going on in your life, but I can't understand why you didn't let me love you the only way I knew how--with all my heart and soul.The times we had together were great. I know that at one time you really did love me. I think in some ways you still do. When you had to go--for reasons only you know--you broke my heart completely.I didn't think I would ever be able to look at you again or see you again, nor did I ever even want too. After seeing you last week, though, I felt that I was over the hurt and wanted us to at least be friends. Although we may never be together as lovers again, I want whatever is best for you, and I do hope we can continue to keep in touch.Let us get together as friends soon and share our experiences as friends do.",1
"I don't know what it is about you that makes me feel the way I do. No other guy can touch my heart, but you can see through to the depths of my very soul. I care about you more than I ever knew I could care about anyone before. You see, I never thought I could love again, but now I'm so confused. My heart says, ""yes,"" but my head says, ""no."" You wonder why I care about you, but it's simple: when I look into your eyes, I see beyond all the hostility on the outside. I see a real person with real needs, the one you are afraid to be. But that's okay, because I know the truth, and I will wait for the day when you'll open the gate and let me in. Even if it takes years, I'll be right here, waiting for you to let me love you, as I already love you now.",1
"I started writing down all the ways you make my life complete, and I ran out of space when I tried to fit it on just one sheet. Here are a few of my thoughts listing why I love you. You are kindness and gentleness. You are caring and loving. You are fun to be with.I cannot imagine my life without you. I love to imagine you smiling when you read this letter, and I love to remember how we happy we are together. Do you picture yourself holding me even when we are not together? I picture myself holding you. Just imagining you in my arms sustains me. I love to imagine you and me together forever. I love to imagine ways to always make our relationship better. I love to imagine just loving you with all my heart and you loving me back.",1
"I don't think that I tell you often enough how amazed I am by everything you do. I am proud of all your accomplishments and I am impressed by your strong will. I was proud, too, to see you win that recent promotion that you worked so hard to achieve. You are always on my mind and in my heart. Never doubt how much you mean to me and how much I love you. I will be faithful to you and love you until the end of time.",1
"We have known each other for so long now. We played together in preschool, learned to read together in grammar school, chased each other for kisses in middle school, and then fell deeply in love in high school. From the simplest tasks to the most subtle of feelings, we've grown together through it all.Now, more than ever, it's clear that the crossing of our paths was not just random--the crossing of our paths was meant to be. You and I are two of a kind, two deeply connected souls. Without you, my world is unimaginable, and I wouldn't know how to exist anymore.I have always loved you and I still love you now. Stay with me forever. Love me until the end of our lives.",1
"I never thought that I would ever find what it means to really love someone. You have taught me what it means to truly love another person. More than that, our love taught me to feel better about myself. It is because of you that I am the person I am today. It is because of you that I know loyalty and commitment, dedication and pride, peace and contentment. It is because of you that I can smile with confidence, even on a day when clouds are forming with more troubles to overcome. It is because of you that I look forward to each new day. It is because of you that I know that our love is real.",1
"When I look into your eyes, I know there is a bond between us that no one can break. The look you give me with those eyes when you think I'm not looking is all I need to know that you're the one for me. When I look in your eyes, I see the love that abides deep within your soul--that look tells me you love me in so many more ways than one. When two people love each other, they don't look at each other; they just look in the same direction.",1
"The way I think about you all the time amazes me. I have never loved anyone like this before. After all this time, whenever you walk into the room, my heart still skips a beat. It is comforting to look across the room at you and find you looking at me; somehow I know what you're thinking. This is a magical bond we share, and I treasure it in my heart.Your touch just consumes me, and I find myself time and again completely surrendering to your love. For me, there is no control, not when it comes to how I feel about you. You are the world to me, and my world is brighter because our paths have crossed.If we travel through life hand-in-hand, I don't believe there is any obstacle we cannot overcome. With you, I am stronger and happier; my life is better. I love you, and I want you always beside me.",1
"We all move through life as through a journey. Career, happiness, love--these are paths we traverse on our way. For some, these paths unfold effortlessly and with clarity. My journey, the paths of my life, on the other hand, have been loaded with difficulty and, too often, accompanied by failure. I have learned, as a child learns, that with each slap I turn away and learn to expect less.With you, everything has changed. Once again, I have reached for my desires and have followed my deepest feelings. Although I expected a slap and to be turned away, this time, joy and happiness, rather than failure, has accompanied me. I have found pleasure and clarity rather than difficulty.You are the beauty I have wished for my entire life. I love you more than I can say and more than I could ever have imagined. Every day, I know how blessed I am to be loved by you!",1
"Since meeting you, my life has felt like a dream. I wake up in the morning beside you and glance at your beautiful face, and I have to pinch myself to make sure this is really happening! This is really happening, though, and I am so thankful.You have brought such harmony and energy into my life. With your humor, sincerity, kindness, intelligence, and spontaneity, you have transformed each day into a blessing. I want you to know that it is an honor for me to be with you, and it is an honor for me to feel your warmth and affection. I love you more than I can say!",1
"I just want to tell you how much I love you. You have brought so much happiness into my life and you do so much for me that no one has ever done for me before. I will continue to love you for the rest of my life, and forever.",1
"It's hard to explain just how much I love you. You do things for me I never knew were possible. With each look, with each kiss, with each embrace, you make me feel more alive and special.It's so much of an understatement to say I'm glad that you are mine! Since we've been together, an appreciation for the possibilities and joys of living have arisen in me, and I can never really thank you enough for that. You have refreshed my most precious possession--my heart. Through your love, you have opened my eyes to the wonders all around me. I can't truly thank you enough for this gift, but please know that I will never give you a reason to say that I don't care about you. There is not a second that you're not in my mind. I will always be there for you, and I will always love you.",1
"My lover and my friend--I want you to know how much I love you and why.Thank you for acknowledging my thoughts and feelings, whether they are positive or negative, justified or unjustified. I feel safe being myself, knowing I cannot be perfect, but that you will continue to love me.Thank you for the time you take to give me an extra hug, to tell me I am wonderful, or squeezing my hand affectionately. Those silent moments recharge my senses of appreciation for you.Thank you for asking if you can help me work on my homework. It shows me that you are genuinely supportive of my goals that are such a part of who I am.Thank you for answering all my questions without criticism or impatience. You have shown me that my dream of a kind and loving relationship is a reality now. You motivate me to expect and tolerate no less and to be the same with those around me. You have created calmness and safety in my life, which I only ever imagined before.Thank you for the times you've asked me, ""Do you and I need to accept that idea?"" The partnership I had hoped for is expressed in little comments like that.Thank you for speaking so complimentary of me to others. When you do this, you place such value on me that it makes me want to act even better. You helped me to find motivation to go forward again.Thank you for being so appreciative when I remind you of a call to make or an errand to run. It shows me you do not have everything too tightly organized and it makes me want to be the same as you.Thank you for taking the time and having the consideration to inform me when you do have plans. You show you have respect for me and for us. You always protect me from unkind words or behavior, too.Thank you for constantly telling me or showing me that you are attracted to me physically, emotionally, and mentally. You have brought back the confidence I had misplaced some time ago. Thank you for inviting parts of my world into yours and making them one.Thank you for going to the doctor's with me. You show your concern for me and commitment to us and that our relationship is much more than surface deep. Thank you for always being satisfied with our world. You not only remind me of the way I used to see things, but are helping me to get back that way. Thank you for having control of your future and your career. You remind me to have faith and strength in myself, too.Thank you for hugging me and kissing me when I get home as if we were still dating. The passion that I have for you just keeps building!Thank you for playing games with me and talking silly with me. I can see that we will never really grow old together.Thank you for sharing your real estate secrets when you come home from work, then tucking me in at night. Thank you for your love when we hug good night. Thank you for bringing me to a place where pleasure and happiness is truly what makes me feel good.Each day, I am in awe and say to myself, ""I can't believe I just keep falling more and more in love with him every day!"" Each day, I love listening to you more and more. Each day, the intensity and passion of making love to you just gets deeper. Each day, I find myself wanting you more and more. Each day, I find myself more driven, more compassionate, and more appreciative, with greater faith in you and more strength in myself. Each day with you in my life and what you give to me, I see myself becoming a better person! Thank you for all you give to me by just being in my life.I love you and only you, and I want you and only you. I could never even imagine or wish for such a blessing when it comes to you and me being together, and how lucky we are to be in love.I love you so very much, and I hope this reassures you, too.",1
"We have shared so many wonderful moments together over the last few months. Whether out on the town, with friends, or just the two of us home alone, our moments together have been full of joy and happiness.Each night as I go to bed, you are my last thought and, each morning as I wake up, you are the first thought that arises. Between each sunrise and sunset, my mind is full of thoughts of you.Our love has blossomed between us. Our love has blossomed into something truly special, a rose stronger, more fragrant, and more vibrant than any I have already known.Let's stop and notice the fragrance of our love. We have something rare and special! Let's always be there for each other so that our love will blossom more and more.",1
"I wonder what would have become of me if you were not with me. I cannot even imagine a life without your love now. Your love is the sunshine that shines every day of my life. You are the rain that falls and refreshes me. You show me possibilities that I never even dreamed of. I know in my heart that love is magic, and it works like a miracle. Your love is magic, and I will be happy forever just being with you.",1
"Love is the bright horizon on life's dark path. It shines in our faces and even sometimes blinds us, but we are fortunate that love exists at all. Love is the enchanter; it is magic. It can turn what was once a lonely life into a life with a one single breath that is suddenly worth living. Love can also find what was hopelessly lost and turn it into what is found and filled with joy. Love is filled with such wonder and magic, kind of like someone I know now!She is my reason for being, although I do not say it often enough. She is the kindest person I have ever known and probably ever will know. If she ran to the edge of the earth, I would be there to catch her before she fell. Our hearts are bound by love and magic for eternity. My love for her reaches to the furthest star in the universe, and there it has blossomed as light from the horizon on my darkest path. I love you.",1
"The first time I saw you, everyone and everything around you seemed immobile for awhile. You looked at me and your eyes sparkled. They had a shine I had never seen before, and I thought to my self that's an angel. I felt my heart skip a beat and I felt breathless, too. I crossed the road to the other side where you were and said hello. But when I talked to you, I knew right then and there that you really were an angel. From that moment on, I knew you were the one. That sparkle in your eyes is present every time I look at you now. I can't picture life without you either. I love you. I love you.",1
"It's so hard to believe that in just six days we will have been together for a year now! Time really does fly when you are having the time of your life, doesn't it? At times I wish we could go back and relive the whole relationship, don't you? Although we both made our share of mistakes, I wouldn't change one thing; not a single breath spent with you would be different.You are the greatest gift the world has ever presented to me. I have to admit that a year ago I didn't believe in God, or even any higher power for that matter, but now that I have you, you are my angel God has sent down to watch over me. You are my heart and my soul. You are everything to me. I love you with every ounce of my heart and soul, and so much more. Words cannot explain how much you mean to me, and I am truly blessed to have you in my life.This year has turned out to be so amazing. I want to thank you for making my life worthwhile. You are my heart, my soul, my everything. I never want to be without you. I love you so much!",1
"You make me feel so special, like I'm your one and only love. You make me feel like I'm a star in the sky lighting up your life. I feel safe when I'm near you and wrapped up in your arms. You make me feel like an angel from heaven because you never stop telling me how much you love me. You're always warming my heart with the things you do and say. I feel so happy just being with you this way. You're my baby and will forever be my baby. You will always be the love of my life.",1
"The love that we share has grown so strong that it has become unbreakable now. We've been through a lot of ups and downs that sometimes brought us to the edge of saying goodbye. But, together, you and I found our way back to each other. We just couldn't stand being apart anymore.I love you more than words can say. I love you with everything I have to give. As the poet wrote: ""Across the years, I will walk with you in deep green forests, on shores of sand; and when our time on earth is through, in Heaven, too, you will have my hand."" I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you! I Thank God every day that He sent you to me and that He gave us this amazing love that is untouchable! My baby, my love, my friend, you are my life, and we belong to each other.So long as I can breathe or I can see, as long as you live, because that's what gives life to me now. I promise my love to you now and for the rest of my life. I love you with all my heart and all my soul. I'm here forever, by your side, for always. You mean the world to me, and I would do anything for you. You've taken my whole heart into your hands, and what I feel for you can never be replaced. Only you have my love. We're going to have the most amazing future ahead of us and, remember, our day is coming, sooner than we think! My love, I'm here to take care of you and to be together with you for eternity! I love you always!",1
"You are my dream come true, my soul mate, my angel sent from above. I never thought it was possible to love someone the way I love you, but that was before I met you. We met differently than other couples--we met online. I didn't get to hold you, feel you, caress your silky skin, touch your lips, but I carried you with me all day long in my heart. My love for you grows more and more with every day that goes by. You know that I love you more than anything; that's why I don't understand why you ask me if I love you, or how do I love you? You don't need to have doubts because my love for you is real and always will be. If I stay quiet and don't say anything when you ask me that, it's not because I don't want to answer or don't know what to say, it's because there isn't anything that can describe my love for you. There isn't anything as amazing as you are, Honey. I will love you today, tomorrow, and FOREVER!",1
"If the sun were to rise tomorrow as it usually does, but this time without me in this world, I would want you to know how much I love, admire, and respect you.You're a terrific man, a man who has stood by my side through everything, and has loved me, supported me, and given my heart strength and shelter. In the short time that I've known you, not a day has gone by in which I wasn't overwhelmed with feelings of gratitude and affection.You've lent me your ear when I've needed to vent, and you've given me advice when I've felt lost. You've offered unwavering support when I've been scared. You've even challenged me when I've needed it most. When I've been tired, you've helped me along. You've cried with me when I've been hurt, and cried for me when I've been sick.You are truly more than the love of my life. You are the most precious friend I could have asked for, too. I love you so very much, and I hope to be with you always--through every sunrise and every sunset, until our lives are over.",1
"I always thought love was only in movies and songs till I met you, my love. To my surprise, what you make me feel every day is the same inspiration that inspired all those beautiful songs, warm poems, and amazing movies. You became my reason for existing, my dreams, and my future just by being yourself, and I thank you, I thank you with all my heart for being the most important part of my life, for being my wife, for with you my soul is everlasting and my love is eternal. I'm yours forever, not just for this lifetime but for whatever else follows. I love you.",1
"I think about you all the time. We are so close now. It's not like I feel that we have drifted apart. It's just that I want to let you know again how much I am in love with you. I will love you forever and for always, Baby. You are the one every girl dreams about, but the best part is that you are all mine. I don't know what I did to deserve you, but I must have done something right! Being with you makes me feel like the entire world is mine. One day we will marry and have a houseful of kids. I am dreaming about that already. I love you, Baby, and I am yours forever!",1
"""Forever"" and ""always"" are two words that people use loosely. I say them from the depths of my heart and from all the strength within me, ""I will love you, forever and always."" My heart leaps for joy when I see you. My mind slips away to moments we shared. You give my life meaning. Every step we take, we take together, and I know that tomorrow each step will grow even sweeter. Our lives have become so entwined that I can feel your every breath as my heart beats. I know even from a distance when you are sad or feeling down, and my heart aches for you. I know when you are happy, and it makes me smile. I wish your every dream will come true. Your happiness is my only wish.",1
"Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would meet a woman that could captivate and win my heart just with a ""Hello."" From the moment I wake up till deep in the night, there is no place on earth I would rather be than holding and kissing you tenderly.You are a special woman with unique and intriguing qualities that drive my desire for you far beyond anyone's imagination. Never in my life until the day I met you have I wanted to bring a child into this world, share everything life has to offer, give all my love unconditionally, and grow old with someone till we reached the day we can reminisce of all the years we shared together. Just the thought of offering my total heart to you and spending my life cherishing every moment with you, brings these incredible emotions to me that I have never experienced before.The worst day of my life was letting you slip away three years ago because the timing just was not right for either one of us, but second chances do not come too often in life. I will not go another day without giving us a true chance at a life with love and happiness. I know we can kiss and hold one another again.A wise man once told me, ""When it is real, you will know it."" I know now.",1
"Before I met you, my life was not going well at all. Then I met you, and I forgot all about my troubles. I was so scared to fall in love with you because of my past experiences, but then I came to realize you were different. You were unique. You showed me all the good things that love was really about. The feelings I have for you are unexplainable. You mean the world to me. I would do nothing to hurt you.I know that I may not be the best girlfriend, but I'm learning, and I love you from the bottom of my heart. There is nothing in this world that could amount to the love I have for you. There is nothing in this world that would stop me from loving you. I hope and pray that we stay together forever--no matter what.Yes, we have had our ups and downs. We have been through so much, and I know that most of it was because of me. Now it's a new year, a new me, and things are going to change. I just want you to know you mean everything to me, and I will always love you!",1
"I promise that I will always love you, no matter what. Although you might think that I don't, I do. I have so much respect for you. You were the one that was there for me when I needed someone, and I appreciate that. I really want to be with you and no one else. Why? Because I feel in my heart that you are the only one for me in this world. No one else can fill your shoes, and it has been proven. Whenever you are ready, I am here for you, my love.",1
"When we were innocently playing that computer game the other day, neither one of us were looking for love. We chatted as we played and quickly became interested in one another.I was skeptical at first because of the pain caused me by others, but you quickly erased any fears that I had. You made me feel so comfortable that I know I can talk to you about anything now. You have quickly become the most important person in my life, and I am eager to see where our love goes.The first time I heard you say the words, ""I love you,"" it was like a load had been taken off my shoulders. I heard them, but still was worried. I wanted to hear them again and again for the rest of my life.You have opened up new and exciting doors that I can't wait to explore with you. When I feel your touch, my heart melts and my soul is set on fire with desire to hold you and kiss you. You have become my very best friend and my only lover. So, make no mistake, Honey, this is true love.I love you with all my heart and soul, and I always will, now and forever. Thank you for wanting me and for just being you.",1
"Baby, the first time I talked to you, I knew you were my soul mate. I didn't even know what you looked like, but by the time I came to visit you, I was already in love with you. You stole my heart just by talking to me on the phone first. My first reaction was that I was crazy for doing what I was doing.The past few months have been really hard for us, not knowing what direction our lives were going. I knew in the end that if it was going to be a joint life for us, it would work out, and so far things are looking up. You are my hero, and I love you with all my heart and soul now. You mean the world to me. The two weeks we had to spend apart were really hard on me, but I'm glad you're home with me now.I love to be loved by you. You make me feel as no other man has ever made me feel. I feel safe with you, and I have finally found peace and comfort. Thanks be to you and only to you. I will do anything in the world for you and you know that. My life without you would be pointless, and I don't ever want to lose you. Your love, strength, and encouragement are what keep me going now. I often wonder what I did to make a man like you love me so much. Baby, I will always love you, and I will always be here for you no matter what.",1
"It's almost impossible to express how much I love you. How can I describe the beautiful emotions coursing through me, emotions telling me that our love was meant to be? The thought of seeing you, holding you, touching you, and kissing you--there's nothing on earth I would rather be doing.Words are often thought to be misleading, but right now, you must believe me: these words come from my heart, a heart you have deeply affected. I love you, and I will love for you for as long as I live. When you need me, I will always be there for you. You mean everything to me, and you take my breath away!",1
"Even now, I remember the very first time our eyes met when the room was crowded with laughter and smoke. Even though several bodies were between us, your eyes called out to me through that thick atmosphere. You stared into my very soul. Even without words, you said: ""I am yours. I am meant to be yours.""We both know how the next moments unfolded, and how the following years brought us joy. It has been amazing and beyond my dreams. The future will be this beautiful, if not more so. Of course, we don't know exactly what to expect, or what we will create or experience together. This uncertainty is a blessing in itself, because we must approach it together. Whatever we do together will be a blessing and can bring us nothing but fulfillment and success.I love you and want to move forward with you always by my side.",1
"When we decided not to continue our relationship, it was the worst feeling that I had ever had. We both tried to go separately on our own paths, with only an occasional phone call. Mistakes were made and we both agreed that we each made some. Now we are both trying to make it work, hoping that this time it will work, because love and caring seem to be returning.I believe that the love that is blossoming this time is different, because we recognize that mistakes were made, and we have agreed not to repeat them. I, for one, appreciate and respect our relationship more than I ever did in the past. I know now what it is that I have, and that I've been given a second chance to hold onto it.The only thing that is important now is that we have a meaningful relationship. We should not take it for granted, and we certainly should not take each other for granted. I love you with all my heart. I always have, and I always will. I plan to work hard for what I believe in. Please know that I believe in our love.",1
"I can't even express into words how I feel about you. There are so many reasons that I love you. You are a true intellectual and one so handsome. You are the first person that ever listened to me and didn't just offer advice or opinions. You are an excellent listener and that is a gift. You are so confident and proud. You know who you are and what you want. You love most of the things I love and, as you know, it's a rare person who can walk around with these thought processes and feelings. You have a great sense of humor and you make me laugh--those are such wonderful qualities. Finally, you show me how you can love with integrity, compassion, and determination--that makes me the luckiest woman in the world!",1
"I love you more than words could ever express. From the first moment I saw you, I wanted to get to know you. Although I was only a teenager at the time, you taught me how to express myself as a mature adult. You taught me everything I know about loving someone with true depth of feeling. You molded our love into something rare and beautiful. Now that eight years have passed, our love continues to grow. Everyone looks at our relationship with jealousy because we are the epitome of pure love, and not just physical attraction. Whenever you touch me, I tingle all over and that is why I love you.",1
"Ever since I met you, my life has become a perfect world. Your kiss, your touch, your love has my soul wanting you more each day. I believe we are destined to be together forever. I love you today, and will tomorrow and forever.",1
"The love you have brought into my life is a dream come true. Your kiss, your embrace, your voice--I never could have imagined the joy and comfort such blessings create. Each moment of the day, from sunrise to sunset, I long for your sweet lips and for your arms holding me tight. You are truly the knight who has swept me off my feet, protected me from the bitter past, and always stood beside me.For all the days of my life, I will be thankful for you. I will forever long for you to love me with your warm touch, warm embrace, and with your passionate kiss. Every moment you give to me is precious and new. I love you. You are priceless. You are a gift from God. I love you with all my heart and soul.",1
"Every second of the day, every day of the week, you are on my mind and in my heart. From the moment I awake to the moment I fall asleep, my thoughts are full of our love and our need for each other. I am full of thankfulness to have found someone like you.You are really a dream come true. It was always my hope to meet a man as passionate and romantic as you are. You are a beautiful person, a rose beyond compare. You are so much more wonderful than I could have imagined. When we are together, all the problems of the world fade away, and only you and I remain--with our love.We are only at the beginning of our story but I want you to know that I will be here for you always. You mean everything to me, and my love will last forever.",1
"I love you because you make me look forward to each new day. Nothing moves me like you do. You are everything to me, my dream come true. There are no words to express what I feel for you. There are no songs as beautiful as the music that fills my soul when I hear your voice. There is no rose as lovely as your smile. There are no days brighter than the days I spend talking to you on the phone. You are my light in the darkness. I love you with my all my heart, mind, and soul. There could never be words strong enough to express my love for you. You are everything to me. I love you!",1
"I had this dream once, and in this dream was a girl--a girl whose smile alone would change the shape of time, move the largest mountains, and speak to the hardest of hearts. A girl who created the greatest joy to anyone around her. A girl who was the most beautiful and amazing woman. I kept dreaming about this one woman who would be all I could ever ask for and all I would ever need. When I met you, that was the first time I realized that this dream I had been dreaming was more than that--it was a reality. You're my dream come true, my all in all, and my love for you just grows stronger.I envision a fully prosperous life now with both you and me in it, and I am glad. I am glad I can say you are mine as much as I am yours, and I am glad we have the bond that we do. I am glad we can communicate even at the toughest of times, even the greatest. I am the most glad when I know you're happy because your happiness means everything to me. You mean everything to me. I love you with all my heart!",1
"I am writing this letter to remind you of the endless love that is burning inside my heart for you.I am thankful for all the great things you have done for me. You are the most wonderful person that I know! I just want to let you know that I will never leave you and that I couldn't have asked for anything better in life than just being with you. I am so grateful for a precious gift like the one that you are giving me over and over each day--your love!You mean the world to me, and I would do anything without thinking twice to make you happy. I love everything about you--your smile, your eyes, your kiss, your voice--there's just no end to everything I love about you. So, please, don't look for anybody else.I can't stand it when you are not near me because it feels as if the most important piece of me is missing. You are my life and my only love. I want you to remember that it will be this way till the end of time. I love you with my whole heart, mind, body, and soul.",1
"I know some day this will be official, that a piece of paper will say so, but you fill my world with joy every day just thinking about it now! I don't need a ceremony to convince the world or me. I only need to look at you and my heart knows it's all true. Nothing can ever take you away, my love. Today and forever, I will never stop loving you.",1
"Our lives together began with my pursuit of a man who was mysterious and respectable. I didn't stop until I had him to myself. He has shown me what exciting and enriching things I am capable of. He greets me with a smile and a kiss every morning. You're my love, life, heartache, and strife. You will always be my happiness. I am so happy I am your love. You are mine--eternally.",1
"Re: On Cloud NineI just wanted to say, ""I love you,"" and to picture you smiling as you read this. I would like to shout from the rooftops that you have filled me with happiness. I want everyone to know how much you mean to me. Ever since you entered my life, I've been flying on Cloud Nine, and I've not come down yet!I tell you every day that you are the most beautiful person I know, inside and out, and I see that more clearly with each passing day. I love everything about you, about us, and about our life. You have made me happier than I've ever been. I absolutely love the feeling of loving you and knowing that you love me.",1
"I never thought that I could ever love again but you came into my life three months ago and showed me that I can. I have never been as in love with anyone before as I am with you now; every day you bring something new. You make me laugh and have never made me cry. Without your love I would probably die.I promise you this, from this day forth: I will love you forever, and don't ever doubt that. I will never want anyone else's touch but yours. You make me feel like I am the only woman in the world. You are the only man in the world as far as I am concerned! You are my heart and my soul. I feel as though we were meant to be together, that God has brought us together. I have always believed that I had a soul mate out there and I am sure that is you. I see it every time I look into your eyes, and I feel it when you hold me in your arms. Baby, my sweet baby, I love you.",1
"This letter is to a man I thought I'd never know--the one who stole my heart so innocently, with care, with grace, and with quiet dignity.You are a man of few words who has seduced my heart and captured it in a way I never believed possible, in a way that steals my breath away and fills every quiet moment I have with thoughts of you.This feeling of love that I hold within my heart runs deeper than any ocean or sea. I love swimming in those deep blue waters of my heart with thoughts of you. I wish you could see how much you really mean to me. Perhaps if you look into my eyes, the window to my soul, then you would know that my heart is yours completely. If you listen to my heart beat, you can understand the language of love it speaks now. Listen to my heart closely--can you hear it? Can you hear it telling me to give you everything? I do so gladly. Try and taste my love for you in our next kiss. It's a love that is as pure and sweet as the finest candy that money could buy.My love is all I have to give to you, sealed with honesty, passion, trust, and compassion. This seems so little to offer someone I adore as much as you--so little to offer a man that has given me so much already.As time goes by, may this love I hold for you grow stronger and fulfill your every desire. I give you this fragile heart of mine and ask nothing less or more in return. If you want me to be your love as much as I want you to be mine--then I am yours.Please hear this as my declaration of love. I love you with all my heart, and I will never stop loving you. I trust you, respect you, and really want to please you. You are my life, you are my friend. You are the piece that was missing to a very complex puzzle. You will always be embedded deep within my heart. I adore you, and I am yours as long as you will have me. I give you all my love, from this moment on--throughout eternity.",1
"I have such a hunger for you, Honey. I want you in my life, and I need you to make me whole. I love hearing your voice and sharing sweet moments with you. I want to spend my life with you and to grow old together. Stay with me, Love, and be mine.",1
"Thank you for having so much faith in me and in us as a couple. Thank you for making me a better person, for giving me your heart, and for letting me give you mine.Our relationship has developed into something wonderful. I can't imagine spending time with anyone else now or having such deep feelings for anyone else either.I'm truly honored to be yours. I love you.",1
"Honey, you are my one true love; the one who fills my life with passion. I love you so much. I thank the Lord for sending you to me because you are my biggest blessing. The day I saw you, and I knew in my heart you were the only one for me. You are my brightest light--the one who fills my life full of beautiful things every day. The footprints of an angel are marked with love, and where there is love, miraculous things can happen. Our child is a miracle of God; he is our little piece of heaven. My love for you is higher than the sky above, deeper than the deepest sea and it will last through all eternity because it has no limitations.I hear it in your voice. I see it in your smile, and I feel it in your touch. I love you today and will love you tomorrow and always.",1
"I have never in my life met someone more beautiful, enjoyable, loving, and comforting as you are. Since the first day you smiled at me, I knew there was something very special about you. I had no idea then that we would fall in love, but now that we have, I am so grateful. I am grateful that we wandered into one another's world so softly and unexpectedly. Nature took its course on our hearts and joined them in an unimaginable way.I want you to know that I love you from the very depths of my heart. I love everything about you--from your dark hair to your smooth forehead that I want to kiss while you are sleeping, to your blue eyes that sparkle when you smile just on me, to your little nose that I like to gently rub my nose against, to your rosy lips that I know were made perfectly to press against mine, to your ivory chin that I love to place my fingers under just to pull you closer for a kiss.I wish more than anything that you and I could grow ever closer, and we could love, learn, and laugh together--forever. I sincerely feel that between the two of us, we have the kind of love that some people never get a chance to experience--ever. I promise to love you as much as I can, as best I can, and for as long as I live. And no matter what, it's very important to me for you to know that you are my irreplaceable love that will always be a part of me.",1
"The day we met, I would have never thought that I'd fall in love with you. I am so happy you have come into my life. I have never felt this way about anyone before. For you I would give anything and you know I would. I love everything about you, and I hurt when we are apart. I know I have a hard time expressing how I feel about you. Some might say I'm too young to know what love is, but to me age has no place in deciding love. When I realized that, I realized that I loved you with all my heart. I can't even remember the day I fell in love with you, but it was before you got the chance to tell me that you loved me. I hope we stay in love with each other forever.",1
"Before I met you, I was resigned to the fact that love was a part of my past, nothing more than a mere, painful memory. Then you came into my life and a miracle happened. You opened my heart in ways it had never been opened before and that awakened a part of me that had lain dormant all my life. Although I had loved and been loved before, never had it been so intense and as deep as what I learned to feel for you. I had never before experienced the true joy of complete empowering, soul-felt love as we share now. ""I love you""--those three simple words I say out loud whenever I think of you bring a smile to my face and a song to my heart.I feel comfort in knowing that we can disagree and get through the roughest times, realizing that we can't live without each other. I am as secure in knowing I have your love as you are in knowing you have mine. What more could we ask for than to have found the one true love that each of us had been searching for all our lives? I love you!",1
"Sometimes I lie in bed at night, sleepless, restless, and alone with my thoughts of living without you. I think about how you will be leaving me for a better place, a place where nothing can harm you, a place where you will know nothing but peace and happiness. I take some comfort in that.So, my love, pick the whitest, fluffiest cloud to pass your days on, and pick the brightest star to brighten your nights. When I look to the sky, I will know that you are up there looking down on me. Whenever the wind whispers softly, it will remind me of you, and I will smile. You will always remain in my heart, and I will forever remember you.As I sit here writing this letter, I have tears in my eyes, but I smile when I think about having you as my special angel. You will forever be loved and never forgotten. You will always have my heart, no matter how far from me you are. I know in my soul we will never be far apart, because our souls are bound by a love that knows no end.",1
"My desire for you grows with every passing day. I love everything about you. You are a warm, loving, sensitive, charming man with a sense of humor, too! I find you very attractive. When I look into your eyes, I can feel your desire for me. I only want to be with you, please you, and give you the same happiness that you have given me. If I were granted but one wish, it would be to spend an eternity with you. I love you.",1
"No words can perfectly describe my feelings for you. Thank you for being such a wonderful partner. I can't imagine living my life without you near me now. In our situation, it's much easier to give up, but still we both hang on, risking everything just to prove we can make it. Thanks for loving me and trying to set the better side of me free.I love you so much, too much, sometimes. Now and then I wonder if you cast a spell on me just so I would fall madly in love with you! I wonder if we even share the same dreams, but time alone can tell. I am looking forward to being with you for the rest of my life.",1
"Hello, Sweetheart. Actually where will I start? Should I be subtle, or should I just go straight to the point? Let me say this to you. Your love is like the morning star that brightens the day and makes it look beautiful. Your love is like the water that flows downstream and has no end; it keeps on flowing and flowing to eternity. Your love is incomparable, unbeatable; it makes me want to go forward. It gives me hope, trust, caring, and a future that shows someone special is out there who cares, loves, and trusts me.I am so happy that I found you. I knew from the very first day that you were the right one for me. I will be forever grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to love you, for opening your heart to me, for showing me what is called true love. I am forever grateful to you. There is nothing that can separate us; we were made for each other. For better or for worse, no matter what the future may hold, I will love you, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.",1
"When I see you walk by, all else around me disappears--the trees, the birds, the cars, and the sky. Nothing remains but the intensity of my longing for you. Nothing remains but my wish to bring you into my life.I have waited too long to express these feelings. Each day I let slip by is a great loss. Each day without you is a day without purpose. You are beautiful. You are special and beyond compare. I need you in my life.",1
"You make me feel loved; you make me feel safe. Even more importantly, you make me feel wanted--something I hadn't felt in a long time. From the first day we met, I think we both knew our friendship would grow. Neither one of us could imagine the love we would both feel now--not exploding in our hearts from the beginning, but just slowly growing into a beautiful relationship that only you and I could understand. We are seldom apart now. You are my soul mate, my best friend, my inspiration, my love.",1
"I never knew what love felt like until that day you said, ""yes."" You became my inspiration, my life, my only concern. I never thought that I could feel this way with anyone, but you proved me wrong. When we are apart, I am lost without you. I get confused and I don't know what to do with myself. From the first time we touched, I knew we were meant to be together forever. You are my soul mate, my life, my friend. You will never know how much I truly love you, and how much desire I have for you. I cannot imagine my life with anyone else. All I can think of is you. I love you with all my heart and, if I have to, I will fight till the day I die to keep you. You are my soul mate.",1
"From the moment our eyes met, our hearts knew what our minds couldn't comprehend. I have never felt a love as unexplainable as the one we share now. I could never find the right words to fully express my love for you. The feeling is so overwhelming that a day without you is like a day without the radiance of the sun. I want to give you back some of the joy you brought into my life. You are my life, my love, my soul mate. I love you with all my heart.",1
"Since Day One, we've shared something so incredible, something that most people dream of all their lives. You came into my life completely by surprise, and you've managed to make me the happiest person in the world. You are the most sincere, caring, and loving man, and I wouldn't trade you for anything money could buy. You're always there for me, and always give me your shoulder to lean on. You're the one who listens to my cares and the one who I can share my dreams with, and for that I'm always grateful. Together we make a perfect team, and I look forward to spending the rest of my life with you. I love you more than words can say.",1
"It's been two years since you asked me out and yet I still stare at your picture and ask myself: ""Can this perfect being really be mine?' The way you hold me, the way you make me laugh, the way you love me--it's beautiful. Thank you for giving me the best two years of my life. I will always be your baby and will always look to you for comfort and protection. Thank you for being mine!",1
"I wished for someone loving, compassionate, and understanding. You are my wish come true and I am very lucky to say so. You bring so much joy to me. There are no words to describe how much you really mean to me. I love you so immeasurably, and I appreciate you being there for me whenever I need you. I hold you very close to my heart because you are my best friend, and I cherish every little moment we spend together.",1
"You are everything to me! Thank you for loving me the way no one can. You understand me and know how to make things just right. You will never know just how much I love you, but I will spend the rest of my days trying to show you. You saved me from the worst, and you are always there for me. Fighting is never an option and making love is always as sweet as the first time. No matter what, there will never be another one for me, and I will always keep you safe. I love you, and I will for all eternity.",1
"Exactly one year ago, you were diagnosed with a serious illness, and all our dreams came crashing down. Neither one of us thought that we would ever have to deal with something like this in our happy life. You were so remarkably strong during what must have been the most difficult time of your life. No one knows, not even me, how difficult those few months really were for you.I never thanked you for being so strong and understanding for both our sakes. At that time, I was so afraid for you and for our future together. I still worry sometimes, although I know you have completely defeated the illness. No one understands why we decided to go ahead and get married. If they knew how much we loved each other, they would not even wonder about it. I love you more than you could possibly know, and my love keeps growing every day. I love you so much, and I always will.",1
"Things could not be any better than they are now, with you in my life. You are my inspiration and you're the one who stands by me through everything and gives me a shoulder to cry on. Most of all, you make me know that I am loved. There is no one that makes me feel whole the way that you do. You mean everything to me.There is nothing that I would not do for you, and there is no one else I would want to share my life with. You are the reason I get up in the morning and the reason I go to work, and you make me look at life from a new perspective. I have never met anyone as wonderful as you are. I really miss you when we are apart.There are so many things that I am grateful for now, I can't even count them. You have been there for me through thick and thin. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to get to know you and for always being there for me. You mean so much to me; it's unbelievable that I have found someone as wonderful as you are. Even when I am down, you are always there for me and help bring me up again. Things have been so hectic lately that I could not have wanted anyone else to be there for me but you. You have been the stable force in my life, and this is just a note to let you know how much I love you.You are the sun, the moon, the whole universe to me. I love you for who you are and how you make me grow when I am with you. There has never been anyone else I can depend on when life gets tough except you. There are many times when you seem to feel what I'm feeling, even when it wasn't necessary, but I thank you for it, and now I know how important I am to you. In all the relationships that I've had before, there has never been one that turned out to be true love. There are so many things I could thank you for, but that would be impossible because there are so many I wouldn't know where to begin.I know that our love is true love. No one could ever replace you and, if anything happens to us, I don't know what I would do without you. You are my life and everything revolves around you. You hold my whole life in the palms of your hands. You always make the whole room light up just when you enter it, and you shine on me just like a star, but then you are a star, you are my angel. Honey, there's nothing in the world I wouldn't do for you! I love you!",1
"Today, I want to tell you about how much I love you and think about you. My days and nights are now brighter than anything because you make me feel extraordinary. I feel myself flying and feel the world is such a beautiful place now. Thank you so much for your love and the care you give me every day of my life. Thank you so much for your love, you advice, and your prayers.I know that I can't give you as much love and care as you've already given me because I know I can't be an angel like you are. You are an angel of love and kindness. I really adore you and want to offer you my loving feelings. I want to give you a special prayer: God bless you and may you live a long and healthy life. No one can take your place. Please know that I'm here for you every second of my life with all my love and best wishes.",1
"I love you so very much, Sweetheart. You are the love of my life. I have a hard time explaining how deep my feelings are, but I have never felt anything like this before.I really appreciate how you are always there for me, no matter what. I don't know what I would have done this week without your love and support. You are the most loving, caring, compassionate, most awesome guy I ever met. One other guy held a special place in my heart for awhile, but you have gone way above and beyond my feelings for him. I didn't think that was possible, but I never wanted to marry him like I do you.You are the first guy I ever wanted to marry. I want to have a baby with you; that is the most awesome experience, nothing compares to that. Thank you for always being there for me, for the flowers, for your kind words, hugs, kisses, and unconditional love. You are a dream come true, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you as your wife, your lover, and your best friend. I have never in my life been so happy or felt so much love.I'm so very proud of you, too. You are an admirably strong person, and we are strong for each other in different ways. We totally understand each other and feel each other's pain. When you hurt, I hurt. When you are happy, I'm happy. I love you so much, Sweetheart, and I never want to lose you. I offer you my life and my love, now and forever. I love you.",1
"Our relationship is young, but I want you to know that I already realize that you are one of the best people that I have ever known. You have a strong value system that you demonstrate both at work and in your family life. Some of the things that I especially like about you include your kind treatment of others, no matter who they are or what their jobs are. You treat everyone you know equally, and that is a rare talent. You're one of the best. It's no wonder that I am falling in love with you!",1
"You are my life, my heart, and my soul. When I am near you, I feel weak, intoxicated, and mesmerized by your wonder. I feel as though time has stopped around us, as though nothing exists but you and me--not the sun, the stars, or the moon--nothing.You are my world, my air, and my breath. Even when we are parted, you are always in my heart. You give me strength and keep me going. Never forget that I love you. I will always love you and be here for you.",1
"Ever since I met you, my life has become a perfect world. Your love has my soul wanting you more each day. I believe and I know that we are destined to be together forever. I will love you today, tomorrow, and forever. I promise that I will always love you--no matter what.I have so much respect for you. You are always there for me, and I appreciate that. I really want to be with you and no one else. Why? Because I feel and I know in my heart that you are the only one for me in this world. No one else can fill your shoes or measure up to you, my love.When I met you, I had a different outlook on the way things were and the way things are supposed to be. But since meeting you, I have become a different person, a better person, a complete person. I truly know that I have found the right person to spend my life with. You are the first thing I think of when I wake up in the morning and the last thing I think of at night as I drift off to sleep. Love has taught me and changed me since we met, when I knew you were the only woman I ever really loved, and the only woman I ever wanted to be with--for life.My love, you are the love of my life. I love you more than anything, more than I have loved anyone before. All I can see is being with you and being happy for life. When you are happy and you smile at me, there is always a stirring inside of me, and I wonder how blessed I am to find someone so wonderful to love and to be loved by.",1
"Well, I know you must hate it when I say this, but I'm going to say it again: you are my one and only one. You are the most intelligent, caring, and wonderful man I have ever met, and I have been truly blessed to have you in my life. I know, we have seen our share of drama and a little bit of trauma, too, but we have survived it all, and we're still together.I almost can't believe that I am this lucky to have you in my life. I feel that God smiled on me, and now I'm blessed with having you with me. You are so special and so different. You are wonderful and good-looking, too--not to mention unique! There is no one else like you, and I love you so very much!",1
"I do not know who you are, or how you are at this moment, but I just want you to know that I hold onto life and look forward to the day you will meet me. I hate fate for letting me meet you so late in life but, no matter what the consequences, I will be strong, and I will look into the future because of you. I hope you can feel my love, wherever you are. May God send you joy and peace, love and happiness, until the day I find you.Life can be cruel, but it all works for our good in the end. I love you, even when you're still a mystery to me. Maybe the promise of our future love makes us go through everything we're going through now, but please know that my thoughts are with yours now. Take care of yourself for me, and I hope you will try to seek me out as much as I do you.",1
"First, I would like to thank you for one of the best nights of my life. I can't even describe how you made me feel last night, it was so amazing. You have no idea how much you touched my heart and my soul then. I know that you are the only one for me, and the look in your eyes told me that I am the only one for you, too.From the first day we met, I knew that you were the only person I could see myself grow old with. I've always dreamed of finding that one person and now that I have, I don't know how I could live without you. You are the first thing I think about when I wake up, and the last thing I think about when I go to sleep. You're on my mind 24/7; you're even in my dreams. My love for you will only grow stronger as the years go by.I promise you that I will always be there for you. I will always do anything that I possibly can for you. I will make you happy when you're sad, I will take care of you when you're sick, and I will stand by your side until the end of time.I can't find the words to tell you how much I love you, but I know as the years go by you'll know just how much I care. I love you now and will forever.",1
"One year and counting! Wow, Baby, this past year has been the best! It's been like kid's day at the fair--fun and then more fun! How lucky I am to have found my best friend, lover, and soul mate all wrapped up in you! I am so much in love with you, and I fall more in love each passing day. Thank you for coming into my life and taking me on all the roller coasters! That was fun, but no more of a thrill than just knowing you. I will love you always.",1
"I told you when we first met that only a few are lucky enough to find true love. It's a gift from above. I only hoped that in my lifetime I would find that one true love that only a few are lucky enough to find. I have been given that gift, the gift of true love. In you I have found the one true love for a lifetime. I have found the most amazing man in the world. You are everything I had dreamed of and more. I only imagined what it would be like, and you are beyond what I imagined. You are the most loving, intelligent, kind, and handsome man in the world. I am one of the few who are lucky enough to find true love. I love you more than this letter can express. Baby, you're the best. You are my true love today, tomorrow, and forever and a day. I love you, Baby!",1
"Although sometimes I question things, deep inside I know that you are the only one for me. When I'm not with you, you are the only one that's on my mind. Everything about you tells me that we can be together forever. Only you can make me feel like time stops when we're together. Only you can make things better when I'm feeling pretty miserable. Only you can smooth my fears away. For this I'm grateful, and I hope you'll never leave me. I love you.",1
"I wanted to tell you today how good I feel about us and about our future together. I enjoy being with you. It seems that everything we do is even more meaningful because it isn't just for today--it's for always. You make me feel truly happy, and I'll always love making you feel special, too.I'm glad that I can count on you to be there when I need someone to understand, to encourage, and to reassure me. I hope you realize you can always count on me too. We share so much of our lives, but it's nice to know that we can still go our own ways now and then but, somehow, the more we grow as individuals, the closer we can become.I'm satisfied with all we have together, and I'm sure that those feelings will last, and that I'll cherish you through a lifetime of beautiful tomorrows. I want you to know how pleased I am to be a part of your life, how much it means to me to know I'll always be in love with you, and only you!",1
"When I first asked you out on a date, I didn't know how long-reaching that decision would be for me. I didn't know how hard I would fall for you or how wonderful I would feel when I was with you.When I first asked you out on a date, I didn't know love would be possible. I felt that real connection and intimacy might be an illusion, but you proved me wrong. You changed me. In all honesty, you turned my life around.I want to thank you for just being in my life. I want you to know that I treasure your warmth, your humor, and your beauty. I treasure everything about you and feel so lucky to be with you. I love you and I can't wait to see what wonderful moments the future yet holds.",1
"You are my inspiration and a gift from God. You made me believe true love was possible in my lowest moments. Meeting you was like finding a source of light at the end of a dark tunnel. I love you so much, and I will--forever and always.",1
"Getting to know you has been so wonderful! So many new feelings have been introduced into my life. I remember distinctly the first time we met, when our eyes found each other through a room crowded with talking and movement. Neither you nor I could handle that moment with anything but a smile, but that connection cut through the thickness and commotion of the atmosphere like a ray of light through a dense forest canopy, a ray of light through a mass of ever-rotating clouds. How crazy it may sound that I can't think anymore or act anymore without thinking of you. You are always with me. Know that I will always be with you. I love you.",1
"You know I am a good cook, so I know there are a few key steps to follow when making any great dish. If we want our relationship to turn into something great, we need to follow some of those rules, too. If you want to make a great stew, for instance, the first few things you would put into the pot would determine the flavor, the texture, and the overall greatness of the stew. The first thing I would like to put into ""our pot"" is a little compassion, sautÃ©ed with understanding, sprinkled with care, and topped off with a nice piece of tenderness. Let that simmer, and top it off with good humor and laughter. Then divide it into two generous servings, and we can savor the creation of our love.",1
"Sometimes I can't express to you the way I really feel inside. There are times I want to write poetry or sing a song, but they would just say some of what my heart wants to tell you. I sat down behind my desk at work today and decided to write you a letter. I am just a small town girl whose life is very different from yours, because you are in a state miles away, but I know our love will conquer all.You tell me to believe in our love and allow it to grow, but sometimes it's so hard when you have so many doubts. You live in a city where the most beautiful women live, and I am just one woman hundreds of miles away. It saddens my heart and sometimes I cry because I want to be with you, and I don't know what to say or how to tell you what hurts me so deep inside. I know you are successful, and I am so proud of you for who you are, Sweetheart. But, like you, I will try and believe that our love will conquer all.I wrote you this letter to tell you how much I care and, if you ever need me, Baby, please know I'll be there. I may not be the most beautiful woman in the world, but my heart is filled with gold. I know our friendship will continue to grow stronger, and we will conquer all obstacles placed between us. You make me feel so special, and it overwhelms my heart to know there is a man who thinks highly of me. All I ask of you is please, take it slow, and let's grow together in love, unity, and respect. Miles separate us and our cultures are different, too, but we have fun together and we share similar interests. So, Sweetheart, I will try harder and never give up, because I pray our love will conquer all.",1
"There are some things that words cannot describe. The feelings I have when talking to you, for example, or when thinking about you, or when dreaming about you--these are feelings I have never experienced before. These feelings are too amazing and too intense for description! You are so special and wonderful that without you with me in times of need, I don't know where I would be today.My love for you has grown rapidly over the past couple of months. When we first met, I never could have imagined we would be where we are today. I never could have imagined we would feel so deeply connected, but it's just going to keep getting better! If nothing else in this world is certain, I know at least that I will always be here when you need someone to talk to, and that my love for you will never fade.With you in my life my days are perfect. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you. I will always love you.",1
"I want to do something special for you since your birthday is tomorrow. I want to do something to tell you that I am in love with you and that I'm not afraid to put it in writing. I want you to know how much I love you and how much you mean to me. Every day my love for you grows, so it gets stronger every day. It's such an overwhelming feeling to be this much in love. I need to tell you about it today!I know I don't tell you every day, but I want to say that you are the most beautiful girl I know, both on the inside as well as the outside. Your beauty is so captivating! Your personality is so charismatic! It's not possible for me to stop thinking about you for very long; you are always on my mind. You do something so wonderful to me, something so indescribable that there are no words that can really express how much I love you. You have truly made me the happiest man on earth. I have never been happier in all my life. I have no clue as to what I did to be so fortunate, and I will be eternally grateful for you and the love you give to me. I will never stop loving you.",1
"Last night was more intense and more passionate than I could have ever imagined. We are the perfect match, you and I, the perfect lovers and, finding you, coming together with you, was a douse of cold water in the middle of a drought. All that is inside of me was nourished by you--the sparks of hope, beauty, and life. Now that we are apart, my longing to share another night with you and share our secret passion again fills my every waking moment. Until then, I will hold the memory of our passion dear to me.",1
"What can I say to make you see that I will always love you? How can I convey the depth of my passion and longing? When I look into your eyes, I feel my heart pounding inside my body. When I kiss your lips, every nerve in my skin comes alive. Like air and earth, like sunshine and shade, you are essential to my world. Like food and water, without you I could not survive.Stay with me always. Always give me your warm touch, your loving look, and your kind words. I need you, and I will love you and cherish you forever. Until my very last breath, I am yours and yours alone.",1
"From the start, from our very first moments together, I knew something special was happening between us. I knew then--just as I know now--that we are perfect for each other. We complement each other's strengths. We repair each other's faults. We love each other deeply, plainly, and simply.We are two of the luckiest people alive and together we can do things that we never thought were possible. I want you to know that I am willing and ready to be there for you always. You have been the light that shines when there is darkness in my life, and I can never thank you enough for it. I love you with every ounce of my being!",1
"We've become very close in the past six weeks, closer than either of us even imagined we could be. I'm a little scared, too. I fear you might not give us a chance the most. If you let the fears you're having stop us from giving this a chance, then we'll never know what it could have been like, and we'll regret it.There's something between us. I have no idea what it is, but I do know that it's good. Whatever it is that makes it so easy for us to be together is definitely something good.I wish I knew more of what to say to you. I wish that I knew something, anything to say that would encourage you to call me. All I want is to hear your sweet voice, and to tell you that whatever we have, whatever it brings, it is okay. If we meet, and something doesn't click, then if we're just friends who understand each other, that would be great, too. If we do click, then we will begin the most amazing ride of our lives. Either way, we win. So why forfeit all of this, when you're already a sure winner? Give us a chance. Please call me.",1
"How do I begin to profess my love for you? The love that I possess in my heart can only be felt--never really explained. Words are lacking and language is inadequate when it comes to the affairs of the heart. There are no songs as beautiful as the music that has filled my soul since the day you came into my life. You changed me forever.We were created for each other. You and I have been together since the beginning of time--souls entwined, loving each other among the stars. I will love you until the stars no longer shine. You are my reason for living, and I exist only for you. My every heartbeat throbs the melody of your name.You have given me a new version of myself. You have healed a scarred heart and brought into the sunshine a love that I never knew resided in me. My eyes, that have only known tears of pain, now know tears of happiness. I will feel no rain because you are my shelter, and I will feel no cold, because you are my warmth. In you, I know I am finally home.Some people wait their whole lives, never finding the one they love, never finding the one kiss that sets their spirits free. They feel the touch that reaches beyond the surface, straight into their hearts and souls. Surely, I am blessed because now I have found that special one in you. I found everything I ever wanted in everything that you are.",1
"The pulse of my life beats for you. In everything I do, I want to be the best for you. I am devoted to your happiness and I am truly grateful for your commitment to us. The connection I share with you is special and unique. Thank you for loving me and for accepting me, despite my faults. The least I can do is give you the deep and lasting joy that you deserve. From working through life's obstacles to being on time, you can depend on me to be patient, understanding, strong, sensitive, and loving. This is my vow to you now and forever. I love you.",1
"Hopefully you are thinking about me now, like I am thinking about you. To tell you the truth, last night I cried myself to sleep, wondering what went wrong. Just three days ago, I was so happy to be with you, I could not believe that for three years we were together, happy and full of love. All of a sudden here I am alone on this rainy day, wondering what you are doing. It is okay, rainy days will come and go, but my love for you will never leave my heart. One day you will realize that I was the only one who loved you truly from the heart, and not for material things. Remember, whenever you see the raindrops on your window pane--those are my tears showing my love for you.",1
"I want to assure you that the love existing in our relationship is void of fantasy and can't be labeled ""a whirlwind romance,"" or any other fictional romance. Without any shadow of a doubt, our love is authentic and real.I love you not only because of your physical beauty, but for your decency, delicacy, kindness, and other admirable qualities. I can't help but dote on you. All the love I feel towards you comes straight from my heart. I love you!",1
"When you walked past me for the first time, and I caught a glimpse of your eyes behind the strands of your blonde hair, something changed inside me. At that moment, before we even spoke a word to one another, I knew we would always be together.Some would say this is the stuff that fairy tales are made of, but nothing is more real or more certain than my love for you. When you brush my cheek with your hand, I feel it all over me. With each step that you take and each word that you speak, my heart skips a beat.Every day, I vow to express these feelings to you, but every time I try and you look me in the eyes, my emotions become too strong, and I simply become speechless. But please know that these are those lost words--the words that I want to say: I love you. I will love you forever.",1
"I must be honest. Before meeting you, I doubted the true existence of love. Amid the obstacles and competitions of daily life and the rapid and cold progression of facts and figures, love had grown to be more of a myth for me, something only written about and dreamed about. Love was something without real existence. I even started to imagine that people, out of the basic need to believe, had created the very concept of love itself. Someone had said that religion was the opium of the masses, but for me, love was that drug.You stripped me of these doubts, and made me realize that nothing--not the air, not the earth, not the sea, was more real than our love. I thank you for reviving me, for filling my life with hope and tenderness, and for reminding me of the purity of life and the purity of love. I am exhilarated by every ounce of you and by every moment we are together.I love you now, and I will love you always.",1
"Wow! So here I stand, no longer alone among the digital masses. Here I stand, surrounded by people who have met on-line, people who have loved and lost, and people who, somehow, in a desperate world, found each other.So what do I say that hasn't already been written or that hasn't already been said? Hmm, pretty tough! Okay--try this: I no longer need to hope for love by going to clubs, (I can't dance, anyway!) I don't have to search for love in personal ads, on the Internet, or in chat rooms, text messages, camera phones, faxes, and e-mails. I don't have to wait for good and bad feedback, or have to need a good laugh, wait to talk, be told to shut up, look for hope, pray for a miracle, wait for an angel, see hope for God's love here on earth, wish for a special friend, crave for my heart's desire, envy other people's romances, or wonder if someone will ever love me. You're here; I'm done searching. I've found everything I ever wanted or needed.",1
"It's the end of the day and, as usual, I'm thinking about you. I want you to know how much I love the times we've spent together. It has meant so much to me.It really seems like I've known you forever, and it's hard to even imagine life without you now. I will always look back at the memories, but I have no second thoughts and no regrets. I've truly been blessed to find you, and I'll never let you go. I will do everything in my power to keep us together, and I will always love you.",1
"There were times before when I thought I had found true love, a love so intense and real that I would forever be caught in its spell forever. Then the time would come when I realized I was mistaken. I spent the most agonizing days of my life after my great love ended with sleepless nights and my pillow always wet with tears. I always thought I was losing my mind and mourn for what turned out to be just a short-lived love.And then I met you, a new friend. No sooner did we meet than I found out you had suffered the same anguish as I had just a month ago. I found it comforting to talk to you about the pain and misery of losing a love I thought would last. Somehow we never felt embarrassed talking to each other about our heartaches. It seemed to bring each of us some relief.Even though we still have the reassuring friendship we started out with, I'm happy it has grown into so much more. You turned out to be my best friend and companion. You saved me from misery and loneliness. I wasn't yearning anymore for my old love to come back, nor desperately seeking a new love. I was content just to spend time with you. I love your company, your intelligence, and your wonderful sense of humor. I love the way you make me look forward to waking up again in the morning, and the way you make me go to sleep with a smile on my face. More than anything else, I love you for just being you. I'm in love with you. I love you, and I'll always love you.",1
"We have been married for about 14 years now. No matter what, you have always cherished me. God purposely gave me to you for a reason. He knew you would always love me and never neglect me. You are my true knight in shining armor. God must have known all along what he was doing when I first met you. I love the way you have always thought enough of me to never leave me and to never hurt me. My heart is like a thin piece of ice--it never takes much to break it. God knew you were right for me from the very beginning. I love you!",1
"The past few years have flown by so quickly! It seems like only yesterday we were lying in the back of your truck, watching the stars in the sky. It seems like only yesterday we were kissing for the first time, whispering in each other's ears. It even seems like it was only yesterday that we were declaring our love for each other and declaring our vows.In actuality, the years have passed, however, and they've passed too quickly, not because we could have used the days more wisely, but because each moment was a wonder for me. I wish I could live them over and over!The future is still ours, though, and with each day, I will experience more of your beautiful smile, the warmth of your heart, and the strength of your mind. I am thankful for the time we've had together already, but I am so hopeful that our life will continue in joy and happiness. I love you more than words can express, and I always want to be with you.",1
"I am writing with the earnest prayer that you truly appreciate and want the attention that I give you. I don't know quite where to begin. Let me start by saying simply that I am smitten by you. I enjoy your gentle smile, your sweet kisses, and just being in your arms. I want these things more than I could have wished, and I cannot stop wanting you now.There is not a thing about you that does not amaze me. I am totally smitten by everything about you. I tremble in your presence, fully blinded by some ethereal aura that you radiate with such innocence and youthful unwariness.I've said enough now. Please forgive my words if they offend or embarrass you. I await your reply like the birds wait for spring.",1
"I don't think there are any words strong enough to explain how I feel about you. I know saying, ""I love you,"" is very powerful, yet I feel it's not enough. You are everything to me because I see you in books, songs, poems, television and everything else. Some people compare loved ones with the sun, moon, and stars, but to me you can't compare to any of that because you're so much more than those things or anything else. When I say that you're everything, I mean, you're the air that I breathe, the light in my life, the reason I get up every morning. If it wasn't for you, that smile you see on my face every day and the glow I have in my cheeks wouldn't be there anymore. You truly are my life and there is no one I would rather spend my life with than you. I love you more than words could ever express.",1
"I do not know where to begin, so I guess this is just as good a place as any. Right now, I'm thinking about you. It's funny how thoughts of you fill my day, my heart, and my mind. I know that you love me, and you must know that I love you too. You and I have connected on such a high level that our minds exchange the same ideas, and our hearts beat as one. Yet you still say you're not sure our love will last once I know all about you.Everything that I feel runs so deep that I don't care about your past and all the things you've done that you feel you should be ashamed of. My love is unconditional, and it will always be here for you. I don't want you to wake up days, months, or years from now, wondering what would have been or could have been. I know you see the love that I feel for you, and I wish that you could trust that love. You say that I am ""star-crossed"" and that I don't know the true you. I don't believe I could be ""star-crossed,"" because I am sure of my love for you. Let's get together, so we can talk about it.",1
"As I sit here, I'm wondering why I ever loved you so much. I remember the days when we started to talk and then we fell in love like it was always there. I thought moving away would get my mind off of you. It worked, but not for long. I realized that you were the only one that I wanted to have. You just don't know how I feel right now. Sometimes I want to break down and cry because of the fact that you don't know how I feel about you. I'm scared of what you would think right now with all this stuff going on. I love you and God knows I do. I love you so very much. I think I always will.",1
"When I met you I had a poor outlook on the way things were and the way things are supposed to be, but since I met you I have become a better person, a complete person with a better outlook on life. I truly knew when I met you I found the right person to spend the rest of my life with. I know that you will stand by me in all kinds of hardships and bad situations, instead of turning and walking away. You are the first thing I think of when I wake up in the morning and the last thing I think of at night as I drift off to sleep.I am so lucky to have you to love, and I am so lucky that you love me. Everything bad I have suffered in my life that I thought was so unfair was worth it if I had to go through it all to get to you. I've gotten through it all to get to the man I saw in my dreams.The thought of being apart from you now makes me never want to take a moment I have with you for granted. Just being together and lying in your arms makes me so happy. I don't ever want you to forget even in the darkest hours how much I love you or how much you mean to me or just how happy you have made me and continue to make me every single day. I want you to know today and always that I will love you forever!",1
"I want to send you my thoughts, so that you may be able to read them and reread them whenever you are lonely. I need to tell you how happy you make me and how much I respect and admire you. We have been together for many years. In all that time, I am constantly amazed at your ability to stay focused on what is good in life. I respect and admire your positive attitude and your ability to pick yourself up and start over again when things go against you.Your positive attitude has spilled over, and I find that I see things in a healthier way now. I see that the glass is half-filled and not half-empty. Thanks to you, I worry less and sleep better. I appreciate your love, your kindness, and your positive outlook. I know that all these great experiences come from experiencing your love. Thanks for all the love that you show me.",1
"It has been over two years since we got together, and every day I love you more and more. You're my one and only. You mean the world to me, and no one will ever take that away from me. I thank God for sending me such a sweet angel.I will never forget that special moment when we first said that we loved one another. That moment is unforgettable. That special moment told us what we wanted to know most, and we have fed on it ever since. We love each other. Life is good, and you make it better.",1
"Your heart and soul carry a beauty I've found in no one else. Your warmth and compassion inspire me to go forward and take new risks daily, refining me into a better person. Your eyes hold a sexiness and passion others can only long for. As long as my heart beats, I shall love you and feel fulfilled now that I've found you!",1
"I don't know how to tell you my feelings personally, so I will try here. I only have three months left before you leave for the service. That is all I can think about.You mean the world to me and much more. Without you, life is all just a bore. I cry so many nights just thinking about you, and the life together we will have one day. But now I worry and ask if our love is strong enough. With every guy, I saw something in them I loved, yet they never had quite all of it, but you do, Baby, all I have to give! My mother told me, when I asked her how will I know if I've found the right one, she replied, ""You will know, you will feel it deep in the core of your soul,"" and I never believed her until the day you walked into my life. I have known that I loved you and really cared about you but didn't realized my love was this strong until you got on one knee and proposed to me. I fell down crying after you left. It was the happiest day of my life and I will never regret saying, ""Yes.""Without you, my life wouldn't be whole. There would be no sunshine and definitely no one to come to my house at 5:00 a.m. in the morning just because they missed me. I love you so very much, Baby, and this all seems like a fairy tale, but one thing about this is that it is real, and I love you with all my heart because without you, I don't know what I would do.So, please understand how much I love you and why I cry even when you make me happy sometimes. And when I get mad at some of the things you do, most of the time it is just because I love you so very much and don't ever want to lose you.",1
"I met you one bright Sunday and, at that point, I didn't know exactly what you meant to me, but now I do. You are the light in my eyes and the happiness in my heart. Just the thought of you leaving breaks my heart.So, on a day like today, let's promise to love each other through good times and bad times, for better or worse, until death do us part. Also, I will never break that vow we made because the day I met you was the day my life began.",1
"The day you left me, I felt so empty inside. I knew part of the reason you were leaving was because of me. I tried to do everything I could to keep you here, but I guess you needed space. I thought that when you left I wouldn't feel any love anymore, but the truth may be that true love never does go away.The day you left was the hardest thing I ever experienced because I still loved you. I don't think the love I have for you will ever die, no matter how much you make me cry, and no matter what you said to me. That's because I will never forget all the happy moments that we shared together.The day you left me, I didn't know what to do. I was afraid to call you, but I continued to hope that one day you would miss me and would want to see me again. I would probably still agree to see you and to talk about us, if you called me. I don't know. Call me and find out.",1
"I am sitting in my room in front of the monitor, with the keyboard in front of me waiting to see your nickname on the screen. I feel you so near and yet so distant at the same moment. Every day I find something new in you, something that makes me feel different but sure about one thing--you are not only my friend, but you are something more, something deeper. Do you feel the same way?I remember the day when I decided that I couldn't hide my feelings from you anymore. I wrote and told you what I feel. You were glad that I expressed my feelings, and you said that you cared about me, too. I was hoping these unexpected feelings would blossom into love. I wanted a deep love that bonds two people together, but I found that we had a different kind of love that was strong in its own way. We were concerned about one another's happiness, but we did not feel that our happiness depended on what we felt for one another. We found friendship and a peaceful love that moved smoothly, but did not become passion.I knew then that we each had found a friend, and that was enough for both of us now. We both agreed that our friendship could someday become more, but we agreed to take our relationship one day at a time. We knew that we would care about one another for a long time. Our friendship would continue, and you would be here for me, and I would be here for you. I would enjoy hearing from you soon and hear what's going on in your life. A few interesting things have happened on my end that I want to tell you about, too.",1
"I love you. You are my best friend and confidante. Together we are united--united in love, a love that is unlike anything I have ever experienced. I am grateful to be so blessed.You amaze me. You make me dance, when before I could only walk. You make me sing, when before I only talked. You make me see above the horizon, when before I could only see across the room. You teach me to be all that I can be.When I fell in love with you, you taught me how blissful love could really be. True love is rare, but when your heart finds it, there is nothing in life that can discourage you. You have immersed me in your love. What a priceless gift. How did I get to be so lucky? I am lucky to have found you. I want you to know that my love is yours forever. I love you.",1
"It was a shock when you spoke about having a family. The words that you have expressed to me were the words that I wanted to hear for many years. You say that you are willing to prove everything to me to make it happen, and I am willing to be patient to see where we go.Somehow, I feel that you will be a man of your word, and I feel that I will also hold true to my words. I want the two of us to be happy. I want you to be my soul mate, my partner through life. I want to see us grow old together, if that is what you are ready for. I feel like I have always known you in the past, and I want to know you forever in the future. Maybe what I am saying is crazy or just a fantasy, but I know that it is a special dream for me to be with you. I can see us being together and caring for each other like my mother and father. That is not too much to ask. You are the love that I have always wanted, and I promise to love you through the good times and the bad times.",1
"I have tried a million times to put into words how I really feel about you. It's so hard to describe my intense emotions. I knew from the day we met that we were meant for each other.There are so many expressions of your love--the gentleness of your touch, the way your lips feel pressed against mine, the way my knees buckle when you look into my eyes, how a smile lights up my face when I hear your voice, how my body responds to yours when we make love, how happy I am when I am with you. You make me feel all the love I can feel!There was a huge void in my life until you came along. I thank God every day for leading me to find you. I think back to how empty my life was without you, and I am so grateful that you are here now.I can't wait to spend forever with you. You are my life, my love, my soul mate, and my reason for getting up in the morning. I love you with everything that I am.",1
"I am writing to tell you how much you truly mean to me. This last year was the best year in my life, and it's all because of you. I love you with every beat of my heart. All my thoughts turn to you. You are the most wonderful, talented, and handsome guy I have ever met. I thank heaven every day that you're mine. I love you more than words could ever express, more than I can even understand. I hope our love lasts forever. I hope you are the one I marry. I love you.",1
"Sweetheart, I am forever devoted to our relationship together. Each and every day I wonder how all of this came about. We were just living our lives when all of a sudden this happened--we fell helplessly in love with each other.I still remember the first day you entered my life. I knew right away that there was something special about you. What I didn't completely know yet was that you were the one who would turn my world inside out. I can't wait until we are able to spend each and every moment together. I can't live without you now.Thank you for making all my dreams come true. You have meant more to me than anyone ever has or ever will. I love you because you are the only person who can make me smile even when I am having a bad day. I love you because I've found someone who will love me more than anyone else could, no matter what. I love you because you will do anything to keep me safe without even thinking about it twice. I love you most of all because you are my one and only soul mate. We belong together, and I couldn't be any happier now. I love you with every breath that I take, and with every beat of my heart.",1
"There is so much I would like to say to you and tell you what you mean to me, but the right words don't ever come.You have the most amazing way of showing me how much you care. You share things with me that I couldn't share with anyone else. There have been a few speed bumps along our road, but we have always walked hand-in-hand, heart-to-heart, and soul-to-soul. Because of everything we have gone through, I know I can lean on you and be safe and secure.I never knew love until I knew you. I can't imagine life without you now. You are everything to me, and I am blessed with your love and devotion. I love you, more than I can ever tell you. There are no words for the love I have for you. My heart is yours--today and tomorrow, into eternity and beyond.",1
"Ever since that warm September night when fate lured us into our first meeting, my past, present, and future all feel like they have been blended together into a single paradoxical existence. I seem to experience everything when I'm with you now as if in the vibrant colors of that Dali painting about a melting clock in a dream about the future. Now I feel like I have known you for all eternity and that I have loved you all that time, too.In one timeless month, your happiness has become essential to mine. I have turned into an avid collector of your smiles and expressions of joy, striving to expand this valuable collection every day. The gems I gather illuminate my nights so brightly that nightmares can no longer even haunt my sleeping hours. Nothing makes my spirit glow as radiantly as being able to spend time alone with you, sharing our hearts and minds as the outer world slips away, and all that exists is our own world with only us in it.",1
"Here are a few things I want to do with you as we go through life together:Walk together in the rain.Watch the sunset together.Stargaze together under a clear night sky.Spend all day together doing nothing.Take moonlit walks on the beach.Go on a carriage ride through Central Park.Do a crossword puzzle together.Have a champagne brunch and then go home.Go on a horseback ride at twilight.Have our picture taken together.Eat ice cream sundaes together.Make love passionately.Go to a museum together.Discuss current events in a heated debate.Carve our names in a heart on a tree.Ice skate or roller skate together.Give each other a backrub just because it feels good.Go hiking and camping together.Other things are too many to mention, except that I want to marry you!",1
"Hey, Baby, I am just sitting here and thinking about the times we've spent together. I still wonder if I'm only dreaming this magical life I'm having with you. Being in love with you brings me so much joy, when I thought I couldn't feel this way again about anyone. You came into my life and made everything so much easier and better. You mean everything to me and I'm just thankful that I found you. The road we've gone down together hasn't been easy. I know we hit a lot of bumps, but now I'm standing strong, saying, I will love you until the end of time. I cannot see myself without you standing next to me now. You make me happier than I could ever imagine being. You are all that I need. Promise me that we will be together forever and will always be in love like we are now. I want to grow old with you while our love gets stronger every day that I am with you. I love you with all that I am and all that I ever will be.",1
"Honey, I miss you. I'm always thinking about you. It's difficult not to think of you now, so I don't even try.I hope you're happy with me in your life. You say that you are and when you do say it, I feel overwhelmed. Now I just want you to know how much I love you.Ever since we first spoke, I knew I had met someone special. So here it is in writing--I am always thinking about you and about how lucky I am to be in your life.",1
"I love you! Three amazing little words! They say so much, yet cannot begin to convey the intricacy of my feelings--how you have captured my heart, and have become more and more each day a vital part of my life. These three wonderful little words cannot fully express how indelibly embedded in my mind you are, how I think of you constantly, reflecting on each conversation, and on each card and letter that we have shared.I love you! How can these words describe how much of a part of me you have become? How can they tell you that you are what has been missing from my life? How can they express how desperately I need you? How can they tell you of all the peace, joy, pleasure, and satisfaction that is now within my heart because of you?I love you! These three words seemingly cannot express all the things that are in my heart, mind, and soul. Yet, somehow, magically, they tell it all. I love you!",1
"I really don't know how to put into words exactly what you mean to me, but you have shown me many times the great love you have for me. I don't think that anyone else could love me as much as you do. After all the difficult times we've made it through, I know that it doesn't matter to you what happens, you will stand by me and always be there--through the good and the bad.I know now that you will always be there to help us work through whatever happens. I've never experienced the kind of love that we share together. I never thought that I could find someone who could put up with so much and still remain faithful. I believe that God must have sent you down from heaven to be my guardian angel. I am so grateful that there is nothing in this world that I wouldn't do for you now. I will love you and only you as long as you will let me.",1
"It's true that you and I have had some ups and downs. Like all couples, we've had a few rough moments, but we've had our joyful times too. Our times of affection and intimacy are also far greater than the bad ones, and we've loved each other through it all.We've shared our minds, bodies, hearts, and souls with each other. You've shown me that you love me in every possible way, and my love for you has grown beyond description. You've become the heart of my world, and I dream of you both day and night. I want you to know that I love you now and that I will love you always. I won't let anything come between us!",1
"Even though times have been rough for us lately, I want you to know that I still adore you. Although we've had some disagreements and fights lately, I want you to know that I still need to hear your voice. I know we've spent some time apart lately, but I want you to know that I think about you all the time, through every day and night. It's true we sometimes say things to hurt each other, but I want you to know that I love you with all my heart. These times have been hard lately, but let's remember all the good things we have had, and the wonderful times we can yet have together.",1
"Being with you through these hard times has changed my life. That might sound dramatic, but it's completely true! Never before had I felt so warm inside, so complete and full of hope. When you say, ""I love you,"" I am overcome with a sense of wonder and gratitude that I can't fully express. When you kiss me and hold me, I know that we were meant to be together. When you look into my eyes and listen to what I say, I know we will spend our lives together. Thank you for being there for me. Thank you for everything. I love you!",1
"As I sit here, once again, you are the only thing on my mind. Our relationship hasn't always been easy, I know. We have had good times and bad times, ups and downs. But one thing always remains the same: you take my breath away. I could not live without you, and I don't ever want to try.Being best friends with the love of my life was something I never thought would happen. Living together and loving each other every day of it is something I never thought I would find, but our love is real and I thank God every day for it. I don't every want you to walk away.I love you and our little girl more than anything in this world, and I will do whatever it takes to make our relationship work. I love you. It's as simple as that. I want to see our future go on and on.",1
"To be with you is like living in a dream. You make my world such a beautiful place. I wonder now what I was like before I met you. Can you see how you allow me to erase all the negative and live purely on all beautiful, positive energy that just flows from being with you? I knew somehow that this kind of love existed, but I was almost convinced that it was buried in the sands of time.Since you have come into my life, I know now that there still is and can be true love. Some may ask what about the difficult times? I can honestly say I welcome the opportunity to experience every emotion I have with you, as long as we can do it together. I believe that in our love there is nothing that we could not overcome. The love I feel for you is so intense, so free, so overflowing, that deep within me I truly believe it can surpass the end of our very lives. I love you, and intend to show you how much I love you each and every moment of our lives.",1
"I'm lying in my bed with thoughts of you in my head, visions of you in my mind, and it's hard to get through the night. Each time I close my eyes, I start to think of you. I am really tired and trying hard to sleep, but I just can't sleep. You are always on my mind, and I'm going crazy because of you. If you were lying by my side, the longest night would pass peacefully.Your ignorance of my love for you is making my heart ache, and it's broken into pieces that can't be mended. I wish I could go back to the very first day I met you. I shouldn't have moved when you looked into my eyes. I knew you were trying to tell me something, because now I feel the same way too. Deep inside my heart I wanted to tell you, even then, that I loved you.I love you now, too. It doesn't matter if you don't feel the same way, as long as you know I will love you always. No matter what or how, I wish to be with you all my life and into the next one.",1
"Never in a million years did I ever think that I could find the kind of happiness and love that I have found with you. You are a dream come true, and I'm so glad that fate has brought us together. It was a little hard going at first. We had so many obstacles to overcome and friends doubted it would work out, but look at how we showed them! You mean everything to me, Babe--all that and a bag of chocolate kisses, too! And I know that with every day we are together, our love just gets stronger and stronger. I love you, Babe, with all my heart.",1
"Every day without you seems like an eternity. The days I spend with you seem like only fleeting moments in my memory and, yet, my mind is filled with nothing but memories of you and me.The way you look at me with that special light in your eyes, the sound of your voice, full of so much love and tenderness when you call my name, the touch of your hand--those are a few beautiful memories of you.I bless the day we found each other. I'm grateful that you took a chance on our love. I'm happy I followed my heart until you found me.You are truly my best friend and the only man in the world for me. There are no words to describe the depth of my feeling for you. There are no actions that can convey the way I feel. As I promised, I will spend the next 200 years trying to show you how much your love means to me.",1
"When we were playing so innocently on the computer that day, neither one of us were looking for love. We chatted as we played and quickly became interested in one another.I was skeptical at first because of the pain I had felt from knowing others, but you quickly made me forget all the doubts that I had. You made me feel so comfortable that I know I can talk to you about anything now because you quickly became the most important person in my life. I am anxious to see where our relationship can go now.The first time I heard you say the words, ""I love you,"" it was like a load had been taken off my shoulders. I heard them but still I was scared. I wanted to hear you say them again and again for the rest of my life.You have opened up new and exciting doors for us that I can't wait to explore. When I feel your touch, my heart melts and my soul is set on fire with the desire to hold you and kiss you. You have become my very best friend and my lover, too. I love you with all my heart and soul, and always will.",1
"It is so amazing that after all the years that have passed by without a notion of each other's existence, that we will soon be together for the rest of our lives. We never had a clue that our paths would cross so much later in life, and that we would both find a love that neither of us had found with anyone else before.We were always meant to be together, of that there is no doubt. You are truly the woman, the partner, and the wife I have only dreamed of until now. I love you. You are my heart and soul. I am so wonderfully blessed to have you in my life. I love you now and always will.",1
"It's amazing how many days have passed since the first time we became who we are now. I feel as if this is all a dream and soon enough I will wake from it. I hope not. Like you told me the first time, ""I love you, don't hope it--know it."" I know it. We were meant to be. Five years have passed and every day I look at you when you wake up, I still see the boy I fell in love with in high school--those days when we just processed names and students' faces. Now I see the love that was waiting for me all those years ago. I love you, and I always will!",1
"We first started chatting online, as buddies do, almost two years ago. You were there for me when I needed a friend to confide in and for support when my sister was ill. We met for the first time last June. I can still see you sitting on the wall outside the motel I was staying in. I knew then that I was falling in love with you, and my love for you has gotten stronger each passing day. I can't wait for the day when we can be together forever. You are my love, my life, my friend! Without you, I would only be half the person that I am. You make my world complete.You Are My SunshineMy dearest, life can be cruel, but when all the goodness comes together there is no moment as sweet. That is how I feel about you entering my life. You have rekindled the hope called love in me. You have given me one more reason to look forward to tomorrow.Now you are a significant part of my life and I look forward to the day when we can make it permanent. I love you so much. I love you for your kindness, for your caring and giving nature, for your beauty--both inner and outer. Most of all, though, I love you just because you are you. The fact that you show me who you really are, and not what you think I may want.Sweetie, let this letter be a testament to my true feelings for you. The whole world can see and know how I feel about you. I love you.",1
"The love I feel for you is so intense. Whenever I look at you, I overflow with emotion and, sometimes, when I touch you, I don't know whether to cry with happiness or laugh with joy! We are on the ride of a lifetime together, and I want you to know that the love I have for you will last until the very end.Some people wonder if they will ever find true love! I wondered as well, but you've answered that question for me. I've found true love with you, and I will be forever thankful. I love you with all my heart and with all my soul.",1
"I waited to find true love and, now that I've found you, I'm glad that I waited, because you are my one true love. The very sound of your voice or the touch of your hand tells me that I was right to wait.Not very many people ever find true love and happiness in their lives. I don't believe happiness is even possible without true love between two people. I am so happy when you tell me that you love me. When you say those words, my heart beats faster and my voice is unsteady when I reply that I love you, too.I can never know enough about you. I love to hear about your life experiences, and I love to share mine with you, too. I know my secrets and thoughts are safe with you because you are my one true love.We are perfect for each other in every way.",1
"When I met you, my life could not have been in a worse state. I had lost count of how many times my heart had been broken, and life just didn't seem worth living anymore, then you came along.From the first time I saw you, I knew you were someone that could make me smile again. You had such a warm, soft look on your face that I knew there was love and friendship in your heart. We started out as friends, and you were the stable force I needed in my life. I soon began to realize that what I was feeling for you was growing into more than friendship--something so overwhelming that I couldn't even believe it myself. You opened my heart to so many new and wonderful things! You made me feel that I was someone worth loving again and showed me what true love really is.Now, three years later, we are husband and wife! What I thought was love in past relationships, I now know was only a taste of the true love to come. You have given me hope again, fulfilled all my dreams, and given me reason to go on. You have helped me become a better person and a better friend. You have me helped me grow in more ways than I could ever imagine! The depth of the love you have given me is sometimes so hard to believe that I still have to pinch myself to make sure I really am awake and not just enjoying it in a dream!I love you so much and always will! I'm very thankful to be sharing this great love with you. I love you.",1
"When I first saw you, I knew something was different about you. I wanted to talk to you for a long time, but I did not have the courage to talk to you at all. I thank God every day that He brought you into my life.I had no idea that things would end up the way they are now. I could never have guessed that you would be my wife, and I would not change anything about us. I love you with all my heart and soul. You fill me with so much happiness. When I go off every day to work, there is only one thing that keeps me going from day to day, and that is the assurance I will be able to spend time with you when I come home. Knowing I will be able to spend the rest of my life with you fills me with so much joy that tears come to my eyes. I smile every time I hear your voice. You mean the world to me, and I never want to lose you. I love you.",1
"I know this love was unexpected for both of us. It was like magic when I looked into your eyes as you entered the door. At that very moment, I knew without a single doubt that my life was about to change, and it certainly did, and only for the better!It's been months now since we decided to fully commit ourselves to each other, and I want you to know that I have never in my life been more content. Everything about you is a wonder to me. You are a treasure and a gift. Whenever a second passes that you're not by my side, I miss you, and I long for your soft lips, your tender touch, and the warmth of your embrace. I love you so much!",1
"Hey, you! Well, right now I'm about to go to sleep but, before I do, I've decided to end this wonderful day with a little note I wrote for you. Baby, I've got to say, your love has brought me happiness from the day you asked, ""Would you be my girl?""Isn't it amazing how two strangers with two separate worlds meet and fall in love? I never thought I would wake up and realize how beautiful you are to me. You showed me the right from the wrong; you gave me strength to believe in love. You were the one who taught me how to be myself and to be strong. Baby, I have so much faith in you that I never thought I would say this: you're the love of my life, the one I choose to marry. I want to wake up every day beside you and build our own family together. I'm so thankful for having you in my life. You are the love of my life, now until the end. I love you!",1
"We create a harmony together that people rarely experience in this life. Like bow on a string, we complement and enhance each other perfectly. We bring out the beauty and resonance in each other. As a couple, it's clear that our love is meant to be.We have both been through so many heartaches before, and I know that we have learned too much through this life to ever take each other for granted. I know that we will never grow tired of exploring with each other or of learning new things together. I know that our life together will always be an exhilarating journey and a mesmerizing constellation of all that is good.I am so thankful to be with you. I want you to feel the unwavering love I have for you, so that I can make you ecstatically happy. I don't want you to doubt for a moment that you are everything I need and want. I cannot remember any time when I have wanted anyone or anything more. You consume me. There are simply no words to adequately describe the depth of my feelings for you. I love you in every way.",1
"I do not need a special day like this to say how very much I love you. You are in my thoughts every day, and I cannot think of being without you.An old song about Valentines says, ""You make me happy,"" and you certainly do. There is nothing about you that I do not love--I love your hair, your voice, your eyes, the sound of your laugh, and especially the way you smile at me.I am the luckiest person alive to be able to call you my sweetheart, my Valentine.",1
"You are my very special Valentine, and I am lucky to have you in my life. From the very first moment that our eyes met, I knew that I had to be with you.A popular movie star said to his girlfriend, ""You complete me."" I feel that way about you because without you, I would be one sad and lonely person.So I take this special day to tell you that I love you very much and hope that you will always love me.",1
"My Sweet Valentine,I know I do not often say that I love you. I know I should say those words more often, so I am glad that I get this chance to send my love to you on Valentine's Day. You once told me that flowers are great but you would rather hear me tell you how I feel. So here goes:I love you in the morning; I love you in the afternoon; I love you at night.I love you when you look sleepy and have no makeup on.I love you when you are all dressed up.I love you when you are sad, and I love you when you are mad (but not as much).I love you as my wife, and I love you as the mother of our children.I especially love you as I watch you with our children. You are the best.",1
"A famous woman poet wrote a poem to her husband; she said, ""How do I love you? Let me count the ways."" Then she gave lots of examples to say that her love filled volumes and was overwhelming. That is how I feel. My love for you is huge; it takes my breath away, and I never want to be out of your sight or out of your arms.You are the best husband, and although these years with you have gone by fast, each year has many wonderful memories.You are my very special Valentine, husband dearest, and I hope to express how much I love you every time we are together.",1
"Will you be my Valentine? Although we have been going together for only a few months, I can honestly say that I care very much for you. I care so much that I am certain what I feel is love. I miss you when I am not with you, and when we are together I am happy.Will you be my Valentine today and always?Please say yes. If you do, I'll be the happiest person on earth.",1
"I know that my thoughts are only reflecting the loving hope of my heart because, whenever they wander, they always take me back to you. I love you beyond what words can express because you are such an important part of me, such a precious part of my life. Yet it's hard to convey the depth of my love. It's difficult to express the changes you have made in my life and the meaning you have added to my life. Words do not do justice to my emotions when I want you, need you, and love you with every breath of my being. I love you beyond words and action, beyond meaning. My mind, my body, even my senses are full of you. You are as important to my life as the very beat of my heart. I hope you can look into my eyes and deep within my soul and know that you are the part of me that I treasure most.",1
"I know that we have both hard times and good times. I do try to admit when I'm wrong and when it's only pride that keeps me from saying that I was wrong. Why it is that love can make people do things without thinking them through first? That is why I fell in love with you when you were standing there in the rain waiting for me. I could tell you were waiting for me just because of the way you looked in my eyes. I could see your soul then, knowing that we would spend the rest of our lives together. Without you, I feel like there would be no tomorrow, so where would I be without you?",1
"I wanted to send you this letter because I think that you need to know what I am feeling. I thought this might be a way of telling you, so that someday you can look back on this letter when you are feeling down and not forget what you mean to me, and how special you are to me.I know that we have had our share of problems, but what relationship doesn't? Please understand that loving you has changed my life forever. Each moment that you and I spend together is so magical that I catch myself smiling for no reason at all when I think about you. It feels so good to know that you accept me for who I am and that I can always count on you and trust you. There is a magic about you that attracts me to you like no one else can. You are so fun to be with, so interesting, and so irresistible. Whenever we are together, I feel so at ease and comfortable talking to you about everything and anything. I really enjoy being with you and sharing myself with you. The memories that I have of our relationship are everlasting; I wouldn't trade them for anything in the world.I want you to know how important you are to me and that I treasure every moment with you. Having you in my life has taught me the true meaning of love, and I have only you to thank for that. Our kind of love only happens once in a lifetime, and I know that I will never love anyone else the way that I love you.I want you also to know that you have become that special someone in my life, and I thank you for welcoming me into yours. Thank you for filling my life with love and making each day so wonderful.",1
"Re: Flying on CloudsHey, Beautiful! I just wanted to do something to simply say, ""I love you."" I wish I could tell everyone how much you mean to me. Ever since you entered my life, I've been flying on clouds, and I have not come down yet!I tell you every day that you are the most beautiful person I know, both inside and out. I see that more clearly with each passing day. I love everything about you and about us. You do something to me that nobody else ever has. You've made me so happy and it's the happiest I've ever been. You give me the most amazing feeling inside--the feeling of being in love with you!I still don't know what I did to be so lucky that I have you now in my life. You are my favorite dream come true, and I am so thankful. In the short time we've been together, we have both grown so much, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. I love you with all my heart and soul and I will, forever and always!",1
"I don't think I have ever told you before how I felt the first time we met. You were so cute, and your deep blue eyes were so charismatic, I felt like I would lose myself in them.I never use to believe in love at first sight, but that day when our eyes met, my heart pounded and it felt like it would burst. It was like the feeling of a home run, like making it across the finish line for the first time. I was swept off my feet! And when you winked at me, I felt like I couldn't breathe; you kissed me, and my knees suddenly went weak. I fell in love at that moment. I knew then what love at first sight felt like; our eyes met, and there was a connection, like a bond I felt uniting our hearts. I have been in love since that day and still am, though you're far away and we've gone our separate ways. You will always be my first and greatest love. You will always live in my heart for all eternity.",1
"Hello! It's been a long time since we saw each other last, but it doesn't matter at all. You're in my heart wherever I go. I want you to know how grateful I am to be a part of your life, and you will always be a part of mine. You are my inspiration for everything I do now. No one could separate us. I love you!",1
"From time to time you ask me why I chose you. You want to know what was so special about you. Well, that reason is simple. I chose you because you are YOU! I have never had anyone treat me the way you do. I have never had anyone just look at me and make me feel beautiful. You do that to me! You make me feel special and wanted. As liberal as I can be, I would never do anything to hurt you. You mean more to me than you realize, and I hope that one day I can prove all of this to you! I want you for just being you!",1
"From time to time you ask me, ""Why did you choose me?"" Well, the reason is simple. I chose you simply because you are YOU! I have never had anyone treat me the way you do. I have never had anyone be able to just look at me and make me feel beautiful. You make me feel special and wanted. I would never do anything to hurt you. You mean more to me now than you could ever realize. I am hoping that one day I can prove all of this to you! I want you just because you're you!",1
"I love you with all my heart, not just because today is our anniversary. No matter how tough this relationship gets or how hard it may seem to move forward, I will never stop loving you. You are my world and my soul, the air that I breathe each day.Sometimes I get angry with myself because I think I bring the relationship down more than I help it. Opening up to you is difficult, but this is something I have to do. You are my best friend and, no matter how difficult it may seem or how tough it may be to go on, I will do it, because I will have the best person in the whole world right by my side every step of the way.You are my soul, my world, my friend. My heart skips a beat every time your name is mentioned or I see your face. You are the one I have been waiting for all my life (not that I'm old!), and finally I stumbled across you. Now I must fight to keep you. I pray every night that you will some day be the one I wake up with in the morning. Without you I wouldn't be complete. Please, I'm asking you to spend the rest of your life with me. All that I can give you is love, but I have a lot to give. I love you!",1
"I'm writing this letter just to let you know how much you mean to me and how much I love you. The last few months have been hell for me and probably for you too. There was a point where I thought we would never get together again or even be friends, but how wrong I was. Look at us now!You are the most important person in my life. You have given me the three most wonderful things ever: love, marriage, and a child. No one else could ever give me more than that. You mean so much to me, and I want to spend the rest of my life showing you how much.I want to make you as happy as you make me. I will always be here for you when you need me and, no matter what life brings us, I will always be by your side. I may not always tell you or show you how much you mean to me but, from the bottom of my heart, I love you so much. There is nothing that anyone else could offer me that could have the power to take me away from you again. Nobody could make me feel the way that you make me feel, and I hope you feel the same. You are always there for me--no matter what. You cheer me up when I'm feeling down, and I just want to thank you for that. I will always love you and be with you all my life, with all my love.",1
"With each passing day, my love for you grows stronger. The more I walk beside you, the more I talk with you, and the more we trust each other, the more I feel I have no need to worry. You are with me, and I am with you. Together our world is beautiful and full of possibilities. I love you and I'll never stop feeling that way. You have renewed my life, and I am forever grateful.",1
"My love, you are my life. I love you more than anything, more than I have loved anyone before. I can see myself being with you for eternity now and being eternally happy. When you are happy and you smile at me, my heart melts, and I wonder how I could be so lucky as to find someone so wonderful to love and who would love me, too. When you are sad, my heart breaks, and I want to do whatever is in my power to make you smile your beautiful smile in return. When you are upset with me, my heart aches, and I can think of nothing but how I regret whatever it is I may have done.I desperately need your love and your affection, and I feel that without it I would shrivel up into nothing and disappear. You are so beautiful. You are so beautiful. I look in the mirror and wonder how someone like you could want me. You are all that I could ever want--partner, friend, and lover. You are amazing, wonderful, sexy, beautiful, playful, alluring, sensual, loving, caring--undeniably the most perfect person I have ever met or that could ever be. I can't imagine where I would be or what I would do without you in my life.I look back on the day that I told you was serendipity. Meeting you has made me believe in fate. We were meant to be. Now and forever we belong to each other. After loving you, I could never want anyone else. I hope we will happily travel through our lives together until we are that perfect middle-aged couple people, good-naturedly making jokes at each other's expense, only to laugh, then go upstairs and make love.I love you so much that these words cannot begin to express the emotion. There are no words that can really express how I feel about you and how truly and deeply I love you.",1
"I've told you many times and I want to tell you again, I really thank heaven for you in my life. Maybe you will never know how much I love, care, and cherish you in this lifetime. Whenever you're just driving, I'm worried about you because you mean so much to me. You're even more precious to me than my own life! I never want to lose you, Sweetheart.Though at times you don't always tell me that you care, your actions speak it all. I will always remember the little things you do for me, and I'll keep them in my heart, where you'll always be. I know at times I'm getting out of hand and hard to handle, but your patience is always the peacekeeper for us. As a result, we don't quarrel often. Thank you.In the past I had always yearned for a relationship that is genuine and lasting, and I've found it in you. I'll make sure that the hand I'm holding will always be yours. Whether we're living in a fairy tale or a non-fairy tale world, I still believe there is such a thing as ""They lived happily ever after."" Even if you don't believe in it, we can make it happen in our relationship!I really look forward to the day when we will be walking down the aisle hand-in-hand and, in the name of love, we exchange marriage rings, then look into each other's eyes, and say, ""With this ring I thee wed."" I love you!",1
"I love you with all my heart! I will never forget all of the good times we have had together, and I will definitely never forget you and the way you have changed me. I have never felt this way about any guy I have ever met. You have made me the happiest girl in the world! When I am with you, time just rushes by, and I can't even begin to explain how you make me feel, but it's the best feeling in the world. I swear, every time I hear your name my heart just skips a beat! You are the most wonderful guy I have ever known. You have absolutely no idea how much I really love you--but trust me, it's more than you will ever know. I hope we last forever! Thanks for everything you do, Babe. I will love you always and forever.",1
"Hey, Baby, how are you? I miss you. You have been away so long now. But while you are away, I thought I would write and tell you something that has been on my mind for awhile now. Remember how you asked me if I loved you? Yes, I do love you. In fact, I have loved you for a long time now, but have been too shy to show you my feelings. See, I have been hurt before, and I really didn't want to get hurt again, but then I later realized that you really do love me. You actually do understand me, and you really do care about me. I thought I should let you know how I feel before you think I don't care. When you come back from your trip, we will be able to talk about it more. So, the answer to your question for now is--yes, I really do love you.",1
"I remember that you used to say that nobody fully lives if they do not find the right person to love. You were right. I know that now. I know that I, too, can't really live without you. I know that if I lose you, some part of me is going to die--the part of me that was born when we first fell in love. That is the essential part that came to life and then grew as our relationship grew, but it now seems to be slipping away.If I lose you, that part of me is going to die. I'll be the same person I was before we fell in love. I don't want to be without you, so I want you to know that I am sorry from the bottom of my heart. Please be a part of me again.I never wanted to hurt you. I guess I couldn't handle my anger. I don't want to hurt you ever again. I really want you to be happy all the time, and I don't want any pain or sorrow to even come near you again.I don't know what the future has in store for us as a couple, but I do know that one thing is never going to change, and that is my love for you. I loved you yesterday, I love you today, and I'll love you tomorrow.",1
"I love you because you make me look forward to each new day. You're everything to me, a dream come true. There are no words to express what I feel for you. There are no songs as beautiful as the music that fills my soul when I hear your voice. There are no roses as lovely as what I see in your smile. Nothing moves me like you do. There are no days brighter than the days I spend talking to you on the phone. You're my light in the darkness. There could never be words strong enough to express my love for you. I love you with all my heart and soul. You're everything to me. I love you so much!",1
"Sometimes words can sound a bit unbelievable. But right now, I mean exactly what I say: you mean everything to me. Since we've been together and you've been by my side, I feel more joyful, more alive, and more complete than ever. Every time we talk or even look at each other, the depth and warmth of our connection takes hold of me, and I want you to know that I am very grateful.You have become the heart of my life. I'll say it again: you are everything to me. Nothing compares to the love we share, and nothing can come between us.I will be yours forever.",1
"I can't explain the way I feel about you right now. I just love you so much it makes me want to cry. You say things to me that make me light up. Whenever I'm sick, you make me feel better. Whenever I'm tired, you let me sleep, even if you want to talk to me. Whenever I'm sad, you do whatever you can to make me feel better. When I'm mad, you leave me alone to let me cool down. Whenever you're around me, I usually just melt anyway! Whenever my day is bad and I see you, all my worries go away. You mean everything to me, and I hope you know that. I never felt this way about anyone else, and I hope you feel the same. I love you. Will you marry me?",1
"I just wanted you to know how much I deeply, truly love you. We've been together for almost three years now, and nothing could change the way I feel about you--or about us as a couple. You are my one and only. I don't think there could ever be enough words in this world to express how I truly feel about you. I love you so much; I just don't know how I could ever explain that differently. But I do know that the one person I can count on always is you. I hope you know this and if you don't, hopefully you'll know it now and forever. I love you with all my heart.",1
"I have waited so long to be able to wake up every day and see your beautiful face. I'm so thankful that you're here, that I never have to be apart from you. Writing this now makes tears come to my eyes. I have such strong love for you that I could burst into tears just because I love you. Sure, I tell you that I love you, and I try to show you, too, but no matter what I do for the rest of both our lives, you will never know exactly what I feel inside. How you make me feel is something that can only be felt, but never explained. You take my breath away with some of the things you say. Just the way I feel when I lie down with you, your arms wrapped around me, holding me like I'm your baby, I am surprised at how tears can come to my eyes out of joy. My love for you is so strong that even I don't always realize how much I love you and cherish you.You say I'm perfect and that you're the luckiest guy in the world, but you don't see what I see when I look at you. To me, you make me feel so lucky to even have you in my life or even to glance my way. I don't know what I did to deserve you in my life, you are so unbelievably perfect. And you are the most perfect boyfriend, fiancÃ©, friend, person, human being in the world.You're my life, and you have my whole heart. Wherever you go, I'm always there with you, because you have my heart and my soul. I adore you and every part of you, especially your nice eyes and perfect, luscious lips. I'm getting chills just thinking about it! They are so, well--inviting, just as everything else is about you.You, my baby doll, are the key to my heart. You are my other half, my soul mate, and I will be so happy the day that I walk down the aisle with you and say, ""I do,"" because, Baby, I DO!! I love you, and don't ever forget that.",1
"When I think of how we met and the way we instantly connected, it makes me smile. I feel so lucky to have you as part of my life now and always in my heart. You will never really know how special you are to me. You give me strength on days when I am feeling weak. You brighten my day with words of encouragement. You always know exactly what to say to make me feel better. But most of all, you love me in a way I have never been loved before--honestly and openly. You love me for who I am now, not what I could be, and for that I can never say, ""thank you"" enough. But I can promise to love you with the same honesty and openness you have always given me. I look forward to our dreams and our beginnings.",1
"We've been together for some years now, and we've accomplished so much. Through it all, each and every day, I've grown more and more head-over-heels in love with you. You are the man I always dreamed of, and I am so grateful to call you my husband. I am so grateful to be your wife, your friend, and the mother of your two children, too. I want you to know how much I appreciate everything you do to make us happy and secure. Thank you for being such a loving, strong, compassionate man. You are my jewel, and I love you more than I can say.",1
I found you when I wasn't even looking. You are the special someone meant just for me. I hope to grow old with you and for the rest of my life be comforted by your presence. I hope to celebrate good times together and support each other through the bad times. Marriage is a journey that will help us to continue growing as humans and as two people very much in love.We will learn things about each other every day. We will have some bumps in the road but we promised to work things through and talk things out. You are that special someone for me. I know this as well as I know there is a God in heaven.I promise you that you will be that special someone for me forever.,1
"""You are so very"" is how I begin when I am trying to describe you. You know that I always use so many different words to describe you and our love that it just begins, simply, ""You are so very."" You have helped me to become a better person and to get in touch with myself and to like myself. You expected better things from me and supported my efforts to have a positive outlook. You are so very wonderful. I dream of the day I can finally pledge my love to you, forever and always, and receive yours in return.You are so very supportive and loving, you make me want to shout at the top of my lungs how much I love and adore you, how I love to share your life, and how very beautiful you are. I will love you forever and a day, my love, because you are so very, very--just every good thing I can think of!",1
"You are definitely ""The Man."" Let me tell you why I think so. When I am near you, my heart tends to beat a little faster than usual, and I forget everything that I was about to say. Your voice sends shivers down my spine, and when you tell me you love me, light sparkles before my eyes. Only ""The Man"" can make my palms sweaty and the gleam in my eyes last all day long. I smile more now, and it's because of you.You make me feel special and wanted--for that alone I am thankful. You are my inspiration for everything I do now. I can turn to you when I feel as if the world is out to get me. I feel protected with you. You have stolen my heart, and I am not even upset! This was a robbery waiting to happen, one that I am glad it happened. I just ask that you cherish the heart you've stolen, because it was the only one I had. So you see, only ""The Man"" can make me feel like you do--happy and safe. I love you so much!",1
"I know you hate it when I say this, but I'm going to say it now in writing: You are the best! I have been so blessed to have you in my life. You will always mean the world to me.It is difficult for me to believe that we have been together for such a short time, but in it our love has grown so much.I can't believe we're so right for one another or that we even found one another in a world this big! It is hard to believe, but it is true, and I am grateful and feel so blessed. I love you because you are truly the best!",1
"Hello, my love. I wrote you this letter so that you would know how deeply you have touched my heart. In the few short months of this last year, you may have come to know me as well as some of my lifelong friends do. That's because you have taken the time to want to know me inside and out, honestly and truly. You made it easy for me to open up again, and that allowed me to connect with you. I learned quickly that you are honest and loving, not to mention beautiful.You have been able to bring out the best in me. You stir up my most passionate, loving emotions. You opened my eyes so that I could see true love, and all that a perfect relationship should be, as well as all that the perfect lover should embody. You are the best.",1
"I wonder why you chose me, and why you are with me. I know we've gone through so much--so many hard times, but many more good times. We share the same things, we try to understand each other, even try to be there for each other as friends, as soul mates. I even ask myself why you chose to ask me to marry you and I have no answers, only your love--but that's all I will ever need.As I look into your eyes, I see how much you love me: I really understand how much you care about me now, too. Yes, it took me this long to understand everything. As you tell me that you're not sure that you trust me and, as I look for the answer, I ask myself: ""Has he given me any reasons why he doesn't? No.""We have both gone through so much in our lives. We've both been hurt and have lost all trust in others, but I ask you to give me a chance as I have given you one. I don't ask for much, only for you to love me as I am and not to hurt me, as I would never hurt you. I only wish to be by your side and with no one else.I enjoy doing things with you and spending time with you. I get upset because all I want are those times with you when we don't have much. As we reach our first two years together, I see that I really do want to spend my lifetime with you, to grow old together to the end of our lives.I know I don't tell you that I love you, but as the days go by, my love for you grows, and each day I thank God that I have you in my life. I know I get mad and upset sometimes. It is because my heart is so deeply in love with you, it scares me so! All I want is to take us away, away from the pain, and just share what we have with each other.Sometimes I feel lost and out of touch, but when you hold me, I feel safe. I could sit here and try to tell you just how I feel, only I can't find the words other than I am so happy we met and have stayed together after all we have gone through. From this moment on, we have each other and all the time in the world to be in each other's arms.You are my world! I am so happy we never walked away from each other. Stay with me and let's see the world together. I will give you and the kids what I can; please know that I will give you all my love, too. Take my hand as we walk through these bumpy roads to the sun shining on the other side where our life begins. I love you very much.",1
"Sitting here and thinking back on how you have made my life so much better, I could never begin to tell you what your love means to me. You have shown me countless times how much you care and how much you believe in me. You have given me the strength to give up something that has had a hold on my life for a very long time. Without you, I don't think I could be able to follow my dreams, much less have someone like you stand beside me.I know I tell you all the time how amazing you are--and you ARE! You're an incredible woman. I don't believe there is anything you can't do. The way you make me feel is like nothing I've ever felt before. I know I'm a very impatient person, and I am trying hard to do the right thing, but the more time I spend with you and the more time we talk and do things together makes me realize that this is our life's plan. This is how our life together is supposed to start, and sometimes I know it's hard for us to deal with, but in the end we'll be stronger and able to handle just about anything that comes our way. We have gotten through the hard part, Babe, now all we have is the easy, downhill slide.You have brought out the better part of me--the part that I put away a long time ago and thought I'd never be able to find again. You make everything so simple and easy for me, and with you in my life I don't need to hide that part of me anymore. What you make me feel for you is nothing short of ultimate happiness. You are in my thoughts, my dreams, my desires but, most of all, in my heart!You are my baby girl, my sweetheart and, most of all, my future wife! I love you now and always, today, tomorrow, and forever!",1
"Ever since we started talking, it has been like a dream no one else dreamed before. To know that you were affectionate towards me is almost indescribable. At first I could not believe it, because back then the very image of you and me together was always kept in the secret vault of my mind. Every night, the dream would always be caught in the wandering webs of sleep and, every night, I would dream of you. I always longed for the time I went to sleep each night, just so that in my dreams I would be able to see you; however, every morning, I would weep because the dream that contained you faded away.The time you left me was like a hot knife stabbing at my heart. People would pity me for they knew how much you meant to me. It was never pity I wanted, though. It was only you that I wanted. It was you that I wanted to talk to, to touch, and to hold. Everywhere, images and objects that related to you seemed to jump out at me more than ever. Every piece brought me closer to the feeling of being crushed, and every piece pierced my heart like the scythe from the Grim Reaper. I could not stop thinking of you. I could not stop having nightmares, and I could not stop longing for you.But then, a miracle appeared out of nowhere. You returned from that distant place I loathed. Your voice sang like music, and your tone changed back to the same way it was the first time we started talking. My desires were quenched as I held you that night, as we held each other so warm and tight. Hot knives were pulled away and replaced by Cupid's darts. All wounds were mended with the warmth of your presence. All the depressing thoughts of the past were instantly washed away, for it seemed nothing but happiness would enter the gate to my heart. I want you to know, I will always be there for you. I will always protect you under my wings, for you mean so much to me. I want you to know that I am full of joy now, for I know you have come back to me.",1
"Thanks for being there when I needed a shoulder to lean on, for patiently listening to the troubles of my heart. Baby, I just want you to know how happy I am to have you in my life, and I thank God for you every day. Thank you for the love and the joy you bring me. You've changed my life, and I love you.You're the only guy who has given my heart any excitement and thrills. When I'm with you, I feel like I'm getting out of control! You taught me how to handle life seriously; you taught me how to solve my problems and to face them without any fear. When I'm with you, I have no fears; I don't have even a single one anymore.I know that when you say you love me and I say, I love you, too, I know that I won't shed tears from now on. I love you, and that's what I want you to remember, and that's for keeps.",1
"I don't know what a love letter should look like. I don't know the best words to use. What I do know, however, is that I love you more than anyone I have ever loved before.I knew I was falling for you the very first time we met. That moment was years ago, but the sensations I felt then and the realizations I had at the time are just as fresh for me today, because you've continued to nurture me with so much love. If there's anything special in me, if there's anything wonderful, it's because you brought it to life, and you helped me grow. You've truly helped me to become the person I am today. Nothing is more wonderful or unconditional than our love.Thank you for bringing love into my life. Thank you for loving me and for letting me love you. You are truly a blessing.",1
"The past three years together have been so wonderful, so unforgettable, and so amazingly fulfilling. I cannot begin to tell you the way you have changed my life. Not only have you brightened my days and sweetened my dreams, but you have given me something that no one else could have given me--you have given me hope. With your tender love and encouraging words, you have given me a glimpse of a beautiful future. When I look at you and hear your voice, I know I am with a special human being. I know I am with the man I want to be with the rest of my life. Thank you for spending these years with me. Thank you for caring for me so completely and for sharing your life with me. I love you more than words can say!",1
"I just want to let you know that you've helped open my eyes and see myself truly. I was a person who was undecided, confused, and sometimes forgot to plan, maybe because of the fate my life had given me. But now, I've overcome it because you've helped me see my direction and gave me great confidence in my future. You show me how to grow beyond my normal limits. You made me see possibilities I never knew existed.Thank you for sharing your life with me. I know I want to share all my life and all my love with you. The past will never matter to me now. I just want to think of what I have now. I just want to think of you. I have found the last puzzle piece that completes me--it's YOU!",1
"I find the real definition of love in you because you have given me everything. The time we share with one another is breathtaking. I feel safe in your arms. I am happy in your presence. The sound of your voice tells me that I am safe from all danger. In your presence, everything is serene and peaceful.When I am in pain, just being with you is my remedy. I love your thoughtfulness, your kindness, and especially your ability to enjoy life and have fun. You have helped me to find the brighter side of so many experiences. I have grown as a person because you have taught me everything about love.Thank you for stepping into my life. You mean so much to me. I love you!",1
"I know that I have a very hard time expressing the way that I feel. You must know by now that I love you very much. When I think about you during the day, I smile. I enjoy you the most when we have moments where nothing else matters but us. I know that lately we have had a lot of external distractions and that those have placed a lot of strain on our relationship. Well, here goes my hesitation. I have to tell you that I love you, but that you do expect too much from me. I am not perfect. I need you to give me a break sometimes and stop insisting that I change. You want me to constantly say that I love you and you want me to say this in different ways. I find that hard to do.All that matters is that you chose me. Now you realize that I may have not been as perfect as you thought. I should outwardly show my love by being more romantic, but that is not my style. All I know is that I do care for you, and I hope that you can feel that I care by seeing that I want to be with you. Please don't expect me to behave differently. I love quietly from my heart and soul. This is the only way I know how. Please bend a little and accept my expression of love for what it is--a simple love from a simple man.",1
"In life, we receive wonderful opportunities to love other human beings. Love comes in many forms. You love people in different ways and for different reasons, depending upon how they have touched your life. Love is a very powerful word and can describe a multitude of feelings, but its main definition carries the same meaning.I want to tell you that the love I have for you is undying. It is a love that is strong and enduring and will stand the test of time. I truly feel blessed that you have become a part of my life, and I cannot wait for the day that we can join our lives together. I want to lie next to you at night and fall asleep in your arms, and wake up with you still lying next to me. You are everything to me now. I want to share your joys and sorrows. I want to be everything to you.You are part of everything I do. You always see and bring out the best in me. You are the one I want to share everything with--my thoughts, hopes, and dreams. Just thinking of you fills my heart with joy. You are always a source of inspiration to me. I will forever be indebted to you for all you have brought into my life. To repay you, I promise to give you my heart and all the love in it for the rest of my life.",1
"Hi, Baby, you're always lighting up my heart with the things you do and say. I feel so happy just spending time with you now. You're my baby, and will forever be my baby. You will always be the love of my life and please, never give up, always have faith in yourself, and you will gain the greatest gift of all, the gift of hope and love you so rightly deserve.Every time I think of you, my heart misses a beat. You're my theme for a dream! Every moment we share together, we grow closer. I'm simply hanging on to each moment, waiting to see you again so you can hold me so tight that all else fades. I thought after you left you would fade away from my mind, but still, everyday I wake up dreaming of all the time we spent together.I will never forget you. I hope you still think of me too. I love you with all that I am, all that I was, and all that I ever will be. Please know that my love for you could never die, and I would want it no other way. If I could express how long I will love you, then it would be forever and a day. I can't wait to be with you again, to see your smile, to look in your eyes, to feel your sweet touch and kiss your perfect lips. Some people would call the way I feel about you crazy, some would call it overboard, but I call it true love. I really do love you, Baby Bear.",1
"Before I met you, I never knew I could be madly in love again. As soon as I met you, my heart met joy and my soul felt peace. I was like a land without water, where every plant witnesses drought. I was like a rose without pollen, deserted by every bee. When I found you, a new me was made.Sometime in our lifetime, we meet someone we had no expectation of meeting. Sometimes you meet a special someone and your world experience changes. I met you and started realizing why I have to stay in this world a little longer. There are times I searched for someone who cared for me and loved me, but I never found, until the day I wanted to just give up hope. But as I started to fall, I met your soft, tender hands waiting to lift me up and show me love and care.My heart accelerated at the speed of light, and every time I breathe now, I hear the rhythms of your sweet name, so melodious and charming. With every beat of my heart, I feel the depth of my love for you. Maybe it's because I keep you in the innermost parts of my heart and my soul. Sometimes I even try to stop loving you, but then I realize, ""My heart will never cease passing impulses of my love for you to my soul, because my love for you is burning out of control.""",1
"I love your cards so much. When I read them, I feel warm and happy inside. Now when I look at your picture, I miss you so much--all day and all night. I wonder what you are doing now and how things are going for you at work. Is everything okay? Darling, if you were here, we would be having our meals together or going out together. I want to put my arms around you when I think about this. I feel so happy. I want to tell you more and more how I feel. I love you so much.",1
"What I want to say is very simple. Thank you for coming into my life! Thank you for loving me and for teaching me that we can care deeply for each other and still have fun and also be free. You make me very happy, happier than I can describe, and I hope that we will provide joy for each other and fulfill each other for many, many years to come.",1
"You mean the world to me and I care about you so deeply that it hurts for even the short time that we are not together each day.I love you and my whole world revolves around you now. You are the only true love I've ever known. All my life I prayed for someone like you and am grateful that I finally found you. Promise me that you will always be mine! I know in my heart my love for you will never die, and you will always be a part of me.Every day I hunger for your gentle touch and warm embrace. I can't really find the right words to describe how I feel about you, but I want to tell you that I love you and I always will.",1
"The first day I set eyes on you I felt as though I wasn't worth anything, but now, looking back about how I went about just building our friendship, it was just amazing to me! What also amazed me was the first time we made love. Oh! We were both ready for a deep commitment then!All the memories we have shared so far, I really could not ask for anything more, as my love for you grows stronger every day and will forever grow even more. I love you, Baby, and there is nothing I would change. Although if I could go back in time, I would only change one thing, and that is to make love to you for the first time again, and make it even more special. I'm sorry I ask for a lot, and I'm sorry for treating you badly that one time. I do love you. I really do.",1
"I write this because I want it documented that I am truly in love with you. In case you are not certain of my true feelings, here is my statement of fact: You mean the world to me. Putting this in writing is my way of showing you how much you truly mean to me. I can't really find the words to fully explain the way I feel when I hear your voice or when I see your face--all I can say is that I love the feeling!",1
"I am writing you this letter in the hope it will touch your heart. I want you to know that no matter what happens, I have always loved you and always will. I know that we are going through some hard times right now, and we are doing the best we can to make good out of a bad situation. I just want you to know that you are the answer to all my prayers, and we can make it through this. Please believe that I am still here for you. Please come home to me and let me feel your arms around me again. I love you and would like to hear that you still love me too. I will stick by you through anything. I love you so much. No matter what happens, never forget that.",1
"We've gone through so many rough times through the past three years, but we have always forgiven each other and given each other one more chance to start over and make it work. I am so thankful that you gave me all those chances because I don't know what I would ever do without you!People may say anything they want, but I can tell you right now that I will never change my mind about you. No one knows how much I care about you and love you. No one knows the way you make me feel whenever I'm with you and, I can tell you now, it's the best feeling. Nothing else can ever replace that feeling you give me. You make me the happiest girl in the entire world!I hope that we will always be together--until the end and beyond! I hope we get married, have kids of our own, and live a life as a great family!You've always been there for me, and I promise that I will always be there for you, through anything. Through the 7th and 8th grades we weren't really in love yet, but now things have changed, and I'm so grateful for that. I hope things stay like this forever, because I want to be with you forever!! Thanks for everything, and thanks for making me the luckiest and happiest girl there ever was! I love you with all my heart and I always will!",1
"I can be myself when I am with you. Your idea of romance is dim lights, soft music, and just the two of us. Well, me, too. It's then you make me feel like I have never felt before. I can tell you anything, and you won't be shocked. Your undying faith is what keeps the flame of our love alive. You and me together, we can make magic. We're a perfect match. Thinking of you fills me with a wonderful feeling. Your love gives me the hope that the best still lies ahead. You never give up on me, and that's what keeps me going. You are simply irresistible. I love you because you bring the best out in me. I love your terrific sense of humor. Every time I look at you, my heart misses a beat. You're the one who holds the key to my heart. You always say what I need to hear. You have taught me the true meaning of love. Love is what you mean to me, and you mean everything to me. You are my theme for a dream. I have had the time of my life and I owe it all to you. Of course, I love your intelligence because you were smart enough to fall in love with me!",1
"My love, you're the one I always want to be with. I want you to know I care about you deeply and hope you accept the way I feel about you. Things were a bit rough for me, but I feel happy now. I don't know what might have caused me to lose track, but all I'm saying is that I love you, and I want us to be together.",1
"I know it is as difficult for you as it is for me to be separated for so long. Life seems to be full of trials of this type that test our inner strength and, more importantly, our devotion and love for one another. After all, it is said that true love is boundless and immeasurable and overcomes all forms of adversity. In truth, if love is genuine, it will grow stronger with each assault upon its existence.Our love has been assaulted many times, and I am convinced that it is true love because the longer I am away from you, the greater my yearning is to be with you again. I cherish any thought of you, prize any memory of you that rises from the depths of my mind, and live for the day when our physical separation will no longer exist.Until that moment arrives, I send you my tender love, my warm embrace, and my most passionate kiss-across the miles.",1
"You have my heart and soul. I know the miles between us are great, but our love keeps us near one another. One day those miles will disappear, because I'll be in your arms forever. You have given me so much already. Your kiss is the sweetest thing. December cannot come quick enough for me. I love you with everything that I have within me.",1
"I know these past five months have been really hard because we couldn't be together. We've both been strong, but the wait is almost over. We can soon spend the rest of our lives together, waking up to each other every morning. I love you with all my heart and soul. You are truly my angel and my guardian, now and forever.",1
"The first day we were introduced through the Internet, I knew you were the one for me. With our first hello and our first goodbye, I believe we both knew it. It has been a little over 2 years now, and we are still deeply rooted in each other's hearts, minds, and souls.Before we met, I had no idea what love really was and then my heart started aching for you. Now, each day we're apart, tears run down my face with longing to have you near me again. I never knew a man could have stolen my heart and made it truly his. I never knew I could love a man more than my own life until now.I long for the day I can finally look into your kind, beautiful eyes and tell you how much I love you and need you. The true beginning of my life will be when you are here in May. Seeing you every day will bring the greatest joy to my heart, knowing you are finally in reach of me. The very thought of you here excites me in a wonderful way.You are my every heartbeat, my every breath of life. What I need to survive and make it through this lonely world can only be conquered with you by my side. I do not think there are any words that could describe the way I actually feel about you. All I know is that you, dear, are the only man that is on my mind, the only man that is in my soul, the only man who truly and unconditionally has my heart for whatever lifetime this world has to offer us. When I think about you, my eyes start to tear up because I know you are somewhere else and not in my arms. But the thought of you keeps me going for another breath of fresh air and will keep me longing for you the rest of my life. I will never leave you, and I will truly never hurt you.I admire you. You are my inspiration for anything and everything worthwhile on this cold, damp earth. I never thought my time would come to love, and then it came, and I was hit with so much emotion and power I did not know where to put it all. I have stacked it, piece by piece, in my heart for you. I truly believe you are my soul mate, and you are the only man I will give all I have to offer forever. I hope you never let go of me because I love you, and I trust you love me too as much as I love you. Sometimes I need to think about you to make myself happy when I am down, and just the thought of you brightens my day completely. Picturing your smile makes me smile, and I cannot wait to see the beloved man I know with his unforgettable smile. I treasure you, and keep you locked in the big steel safe of my heart. I love you, Sweetheart, and that is the only thing that is never going to change in my life. I am yours forever.",1
"Hello there, my sweet love. How are you? I know it has been hard for you to be alone there, but remember one thing--I am always there in your heart. Think of me and my warmth will be the blanket to help you sleep peacefully in the night. Look to the evening sky, and when you see a sparkle from a shining star, that's me, thinking of how much I love you and miss you. Look to the moon, thousands of miles away from you, and I will be looking at the same moon-thinking of you.I am struggling a lot here, through trials and tribulations, but I am doing fine, so don't worry, because you live in me and always will. Remember the first time I had to leave? The promises we made to each other? I am still keeping them. Just a few more months, and I will be back as a very successful person.I fell in love with your deep, brown eyes, victimized by the spell they cast on me, and I still feel trapped now! Please don't ever let me go-as our love starts at forever and ends at never.Yours and only yours forever.",1
"Even though we are apart, my heart is always with you, and we are together. As long as we have the memories, yesterday remains. As long as we have hope, tomorrow awaits us. As long as we are still in love, each day is not a waste, and waiting will prove to be worthwhile.",1
"I know we don't get to talk or see each other any more, but being apart for now doesn't change the way I feel about you. Sure I'm lonely, and sometimes I'm overwhelmed with this emptiness in my heart. Just remember that I love you and everything about you. That's what gets me through every minute of every day that I'm without you. Sweetheart, you don't know what I would give to kiss your lips, feel your touch, or even just to be you. I long to hold you and feel your sweet caress. I have never loved anyone as much as I love you.You make me feel loved, you make me feel safe but, more importantly, you make me feel wanted. We both knew our friendship would grow from the first day we spoke. But neither one of us could begin to imagine the love we would both feel now, not dramatically exploding or thundering in our hearts, but slowly growing into a beautiful relationship that only you and I could understand. You are my soul mate, my best friend, my inspiration, and my true love.I don't care if you forget our first kiss or our first date, just as long as you remember that I love you with every aching bone in my body and always will, no matter what. Having your love has been the best thing that has ever happened to me. I don't care what others say about you and me. All I know is that I love you and that will never change.",1
"I am just lying here, looking at your pictures, looking forward to the day you and I meet, hoping and praying to God that He brings us together quickly.I sit here pondering what life will be when you are actually beside me, sharing thoughts and ideas of what the future holds. You and I are hundreds of miles apart, yet I feel as if you are here right beside me, watching me, as I write this letter. Your passion spans distances unforeseen by the naked eye, reaching me in ways I never thought possible. Your spirit soars above me, watching over me like a protective angel.I know I have made the right choice in proclaiming my love for you. I have no fears and no regrets, and I live for the day we will be together for the first time. I owe you an apology also for questioning you that one time. I promise you, I will not question your intentions again. You have proven to me your love for me is stronger and greater than distances could ever reach.I am in love with you. I open my heart to you. I ask that you take my heart and treat it as if it were your own.",1
"Ever since the first day we met, I knew you were the one for me. There was no doubt in my mind that we would be spending the rest of our lives together. The past few months have been difficult, especially since you're not here with me, but no matter how far away you are, I hope our love will continue to flourish and bloom in our hearts.I await the day we get back together as I miss your tender touch, kiss, and most of all--your hands as you caress my body. I want the whole world to know that I love you and nothing will ever change that. There is no other man for me, and I hope there is no other woman for you. We were created for each other to ease each other's pain and sorrow and to replace our sadness with love and happiness. Come home soon!",1
"When we first started talking online, I never would have thought that our loving and caring relationship could've blossomed this far, this fast! Don't get me wrong, Sweetheart. I love you, and spending as much time as I could with you before you make that move up her to Iowa has been the greatest few weeks of my life so far! I know that deep down, the time we spend together will only get better.We wouldn't even know each other if it wasn't for that special friend in our lives who introduced us to each other, knowing that we deserved each other and that we could show each other how important life in general could be for us. Hopefully, our kids will always be a part of our lives as well as our online friends that we've gotten to know over the past several years on the Internet and then in real life.I know deep down in my heart, you are the one for me and I don't ever want to lose you. Sweetheart, I love you and I'll always be in love with you! I know that you feel the same about me. We have been dealing with a lot of restless nights lately and waiting until we can be together finally. Just be patient, Babe, and God will bring us together. Thirty Roses for you, my dearest Love, to symbolize how long we have been together so far!I love you with all my heart.",1
"Do you know what it is like to look up into the velvet night sky, and yet not see the stars? Do you know what it is like to see the song birds sing their sweet music, and yet not hear their sound? Do you know what it is like to know your heart's inside you, and yet not feel its beat? Do you know what it is like to be in a crowd of people smiling, laughing, sharing their love together, and yet be all alone with no one around? Do you know what it is like when the light of your life has been extinguished, and you are left in absolute and complete darkness, frightened and alone? Do you know what it is like when the one you love so deeply and dearly is so far away? Your heart cries out their name and yet there is no reply.All you want to do is hold them in your arms, and you cannot. All you desire to do is kiss their sweet lips, and you cannot. You long to hear their soft sweet voice as they whisper words of love to you, and you cannot. You just want them near, and they are not.Their absence brings with it frustration and sadness. You question God that you cannot be with the one you love, and yet you thank Him completely for bringing that person into your life, all the while knowing that no amount of dreams or hopes or prayers can change the situation-the situation that is in the hands of the God you trust.So, what do you do in such times? How do you keep your wits about you? How do you maintain some semblance of normal life, when all you can do is think about the person that you are so much in love with and who you would do or give anything just to be with? You feel lost somewhere between the cruel reality of life, and the dream-like fairytale that you wish to live in, and the only salvation is to be found in the arms of your beloved and that cannot happen.Friends cannot comfort your soul. Thoughts only make your heartache worse. What do you do? You pray to God for the strength to see you through this situation, knowing that you will never fully be the person you were before when your love was here.The mind is a whirlwind as your thoughts are tossed around like leaves in the wind. But the one thought that is constant and eats away at the core of your soul is a simple one: ""When will I hear from you again? Will I ever hear from you again?"" Time causes such thoughts to occur, over and over. It is only human. I am only human.And so, I wait. For how long? Only time can tell. As I wait, it seems as though the hands of the clock move in reverse instead of forward. Each second that passes seems an eternity away from you. Time takes you further away from me instead of bringing you closer, and time is something that is beyond our control.Oh, to be an angel, and have wings that I may fly into your arms at this very second! To taste your sweet kiss and feel your warm embrace. To love you, to have the pain of needing you, all vanish in your arms, as would snowflakes on a summer day. And to know that we would at last be together for all our days. Days spent lost in sweet heavenly love, such as we have never known.My darling, how is it that love can be so wonderful, and yet hurt so badly? Such pleasure in knowing and feeling your love for me, and such mortal pain in being apart from the one that I love so deeply, so dearly, so passionately.Darling, you know the old saying that applies to being away from someone important that goes: ""Out of sight, out of mind""? But, my love, every ""old saying"" has an opposite maxim. This one is: ""Absence makes the heart grow fonder."" Just when I think it is not possible to be more in love with you, I discover that I am more in love with you than ever before.Good night, my love. And never doubt that with each breath that I take, I love you more. I love you.",1
"It has been almost four months since I met that person online that truly took my heart away, but now it seems that it was more than that. Time flies faster and gets deeper and greater. We've continued communicating and fixed a regular chatting schedule once a week just to share each other's thoughts and dreams. We even manage to send e-mails and off-line messages. Once we've gotten a chance, we love to call each other whenever possible and that makes the relationship stronger, giving me the thoughts that it will definitely last forever, even if sometimes I think that distance would be of great hindrance and destroy us.I love the way you put in every effort that you can to make everything work out for us. The very thought that somebody like you would always be there to lend me some of his time just to make me happy and complete is amazing. I really appreciate it, even though there are times when I know things are getting rougher for you where you are. I am not sure how long you can be there for me, but I just wish it could be forever.You are my fantasy, my true love, and my dream. I am so scared that things will soon be over between us, and I'm not sure if I could handle that, because I am so used to having you in my life now. You make everything worthwhile, you make me believe in dreams and that they are really free and grabbing hold of them is only a matter of faith, persistence, and confidence.Thanks for everything. Thank you for giving me a chance to meet and love a dreamer that has been there for me for a long while. I am wishing I can always hold on to you and hope never to lose you and that we can make all our dreams into reality soon.",1
"My dearest friend, you mean the world to me. I can hardly believe that we have only known each for five weeks. The more we talk, the more I get to know the ""real you."" It takes my breath away to think about the feelings you have for me and that I have for you. I look forward to seeing you in New Orleans in July. I am sure that being with you will bring me both joy and contentment and that our life will only get better once we meet. I believe our feelings will only grow there with each passing day, and I hope that no matter what happens, we will both be happy with one another. That would mean more to me than anything.",1
"You're always lighting up my heart with the things you do and say. I feel so happy just being with you this way. You're my cuddly bear, and will forever be the love of my life. Please, never give up, always have faith in yourself, and you will gain the greatest gifts of all, the gifts of hope and love you so rightly deserve.Every time I think of you, my heart skips a beat. You're the inspiration for my dreams! Every moment we share, we grow closer. I'm simply hanging by the moment, waiting to see you again and have you hold me so tightly that all else fades. I thought after you left you might fade from my mind, but I wake up every day still dreaming of our time together.I will never forget you. I hope you still remember me, too. I love you with all that I am, all that I was, and all that I will ever be. I can't wait to be with you, see your smile, look in your eyes, feel your sweet touch, and kiss your perfect lips. If our time together could express my love for you, then we will be together longer than forever and a day. I really love you, Honey Bear.",1
"Having your love has been the best thing that has ever happened to me. I have never loved anyone as much as I love you. Every day, when I awake from a dream of us together, I thank God I found you and wonder what I have done to deserve such a loving, caring, wonderful man.Everything about you is so perfect. I know you must have some imperfections, but in my eyes, everything you do just seems flawless. The way you express your love to me brings tears to my eyes! I feel so loved. I only need to think about you to have all my troubles melt away. I want to spend my whole life with you, loving you, and receiving your love in return. I long to hold you and feel your sweet caress.The miles that lie between us will soon disappear, and then we will have each other every day. I don't care what others say about you and me. All I know is that I love you and that will never change.Thank you for loving me the way you do. I couldn't ask for anything more in a man!",1
"My angel, my all, I almost lost myself in my dream tonight about us. Knowing that I am far away from your embrace, I cannot stop staring at the first evening star, knowing that you are also looking at it with your own lovely eyes. Let me share a kiss with you as you read these words, my beloved. So many dreams have gone to waste for every moment we're apart, and all I ever have are the words from my own heart to send you. Let my pen draw you closer to me, my angel, so that I can clearly picture you on this writing tablet as I write your name on it, over and over again. No longer do I have justification for my own life, but your goals are more reasons now for me to utter a prayer for another tomorrow. I will soon be with you, my love. It may not be tonight or tomorrow, but I promise you, when you hear our song again-that will be the day we will be together again.I am eternally yours.",1
"I wish I didn't have to miss you. If only you could be with me always, I know I could never be any happier. But then again, I know that the day will come when I will be able to spend my every waking moment with you, and I won't have to lose any more sleep over you. But then, I even miss you when I am sleeping because you are in my dreams! I love you, Babe. You are my first and only love. Hopefully, soon I won't have to miss you anymore. Blowing you a kiss--Whooo!",1
"I do not like to be so far away from you. It is lonely, and I miss you so much that I cannot sleep. I want you near me at night so that I can feel your warmth. I feel safe and peaceful in your arms, and that is where I want to be.You say that you are missing me, too. Three weeks seems like eternity to me. I have marked a calendar and will cross out each day. There are twenty more to go before I will be with you again. Talking on the phone does help, so please keep on calling. I love hearing your voice, especially when you say you miss me and that you love me.But speaking on the phone and writing letters are not as wonderful as seeing your smiling face and holding you.",1
"I just want you to know that I am very fortunate and very lucky to have you in my life. You're the best thing that has ever happened to me. You made me very happy and you made my life complete.The first time I saw you in person was the best time of my life. You are the one who taught me how to love again. You gave me so much love and happiness. Keep in mind that whatever happens, ""You are my one and only love."" I love you with all my heart and soul.Thank you, my love, for loving me and for giving me a chance to show you how much I love you and how much you mean the world to me. I know we're a thousand miles apart right now, but I'll be right here waiting for you, my love. I love you always and forever.",1
"From the day we met, I knew that you would hold my heart in your hands and you do that now-you completely own me, every part of me. When I think of you, my heart is so full of love and desire for you that I can hardly contain myself. I want to spend every minute of every day with you and know what if feels like to hold you close to me. Whenever you think of me, please know that no matter how many miles separate us, you are, and always will be, the love of my life, and I will never love anyone as much as I love you again. I thank heaven every day for letting me meet you and for falling in love with you because I know that love could never be perfect any other way. I love you with all that I am.",1
"You don't know how much I love you! You are the best boyfriend any girl could ever ask for. Whenever I have a problem and need some comfort or advice, you are there for me. It is you who I want to spend the rest of my life with. I want to have your children one day too. You don't know how much I appreciate you, admire you, trust you, respect you, and unconditionally love you.I believe this is true love, and you are the one for me. Being away from you drives me crazy and makes me want to be with you right at that very moment. When I think of this separation as a test, then I can deal with it. If this is what it takes to finally be with you one day, then I will go through it. Well, Honey, I am going to end this letter by telling you that I love you more than anything in this world. Remember that for now. I love you so much.",1
"I love you with the deepest passion and I wish we could see each other every day but I know that you're so far away. It hurts me to know how I sometimes can be a little selfish when it comes to you, but, Girl, I'm in the deepest love for you!Did you know that I think about you at night wishing you were here? I love you, my beautiful Purple Queen. I want you to know how I feel. We really need to talk but then again I don't know. My heart bleeds blood for you and I can't see. My stomach hurts and my head is throbbing but I want you to know more than anything that I miss you.Forever in love with you,",1
"How are you, my dear, are you tired, are you ok? I always ask you lots of questions, not because I just am curious, but because every question comes from inside my heart. We are so far apart from each other, and I try so much to be with you. This is difficult, but nothing on earth can make me lose my true love for you.Although we've never met in person, I still truly love you. I don't really know when I first started to love you. Maybe it started with sending e-mails back and forth every day, opening with a ""good morning"" or ending with a ""good night"" with a lot of feeling. Then, one day, I found myself loving you and couldn't stop that feeling. Just knowing you more and more each day, and seeing how you understood everything I did, I started to love you more and more. Every time you say ""Hi,"" you brighten my life.Distance is a problem now, but if we look at it from a different point of view, we will know this is the thing that can only prove our true love, not end it. It won't be long before every dream will come true, and we will smile with a tear of happiness together. We'll talk about the past in our home together with our little daughter who you wanted to stay with me-the little girl who has black hair like you, blue eyes like me, and your smile. I wait for the day we are together again, as I know you do too. I love you with all my heart.I miss you.",1
"Many times I have thought that life was so unfair. I know there are reasons why we can't be together. Reasons that no one knows, but they will not affect my love for you, and I will not forget you. You really don't know how much I love you and care for you, but there is nothing more I can do about it now. Even though we're apart, this will not be the end of our commitment. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life.Always remember that I really treasure your love for me. I truly love you.",1
"I know we can't be together right now, we're just too far apart, and I understand that. I also know that logically you will probably never actually see this letter, either. But the same part of me that knows we will be together always, regardless of the way things are right now, believes you will somehow find this letter.I love you with every part of my being. I love you wholly and selflessly, and I know I am nothing without loving you. I will wait for you always, and I have loved you since the day I met you. That night in my car, in the first ten minutes when we got to know each other on the way to that party, I knew you were the right one. I had been hurt so much before, I didn't think I even believed in that fairy tale of love anymore, but you made me believe in it again, without even knowing it. I know now that somehow we will be together always, and I will one day be with you again. I look forward to nothing more than spending the rest of my life trying to make you as happy as you make me. I love you more than words could ever say, and with that I end my love letter to you.",1
"As the day fades away and the night slips upon me, I find myself clinging to my prayers for comfort. Every night I pray to God that he will keep you in His arms. I pray He will keep you out of harm's way until we can finally be together again.Sometimes, it seems so unfair that they kept you longer than they said they would. I realize, though, when you love a soldier you cannot expect life to be dependable. You asked me what I wanted to do about us. Well, my love, I do not want our relationship to end, that's for sure.Just because we will not be able to see each other for a long time is no reason for us to give up hope. If you really love someone, the time and distance apart should not make a difference. Two years is not that long--relatively speaking. I will continue to wait for you. I wouldn't care how long I had to wait. I would wait forever, if that's what it took. So now you have my answer. I love you. I hope you feel the same way I do.",1
"Many years and many miles have kept us apart for so long that it is hard to believe we have found each other again. Now we must make time disappear and miles grow shorter. Our love started at forever and will end at never. It's our turn to make each other happy. We have grown older and matured rapidly; let's spend the rest of our lives together. Through trials and tribulations my love will be true, so please know that I am there for you, whenever you say the word. I understand that there are many things to be worked out, many things that need to change. I just don't want to waste any of the valuable time we have left together. I love you with all that I am.",1
"I am still wondering if I am dreaming or what? How do I deserve all of this love? What is it in me that makes you treat me so kindly? I can't get any answers!All I know is that I am thankful you have come into my life and made me feel so loved! I keep hoping that this will never end. Being loved by you is the only thing I need now. When you hold me in your arms, I pray that the moment will never end! I need you once again to show me there's hope in love. Thank you for that. I am missing you terribly now. Tell me what I can do to bring you to me now, to fall into your arms, to hear you say you love me and to see your smile when you look at me. Thank you for loving me and, last but not least, I love you too! I really do.",1
"Never did I imagine that I would ever meet you, especially in the form of a chat friend. A year later I am leading my life as your fiancÃ©, which I never would have thought of this same time last year.Fate has got her own reasons for us to meet and come this far, but I hope our love will continue to flourish, even beyond the depth it is right now. Distance may be the reason we sometimes think we cannot handle this relationship, but I am sure our love for each other is stronger than we know.I am writing this letter now to tell you that my love for you is so real that I can't find the right words to describe my feelings for you. At the same time I would like to thank you for all your patience while our relationship went through high waves and over hard rocks. My love for you has grown so strong that I could never imagine a life without you now.I will always be yours, no matter what challenges the world offers us. My heart will always yearn for your love and care. I will love you forever.I miss you.",1
"Since the first day you told me you loved me, I could hardly believe it. As each day passed and our love grew stronger, my mind did not lose the wonder of having you love me. You've stayed with me through all the ups and downs so far.I may not be the surest of men, always knowing what to do, or the right decisions to make, but I learn quickly. I want this to last. I don't want our love to burn out because of my mistakes. I believe God has sent you to me, and for that I thank Him from the bottom of my heart. You are truly a blessing in my life. You've taken my heart and wakened it from a deep sleep. I see how much you care, and I feel like I can fly. You are lifting my heart and inspiring it with yours, and it's the best feeling in the world.I sit here, thinking of you, and how I love you, and how you make my heart beat. I could never have thought that I would feel this way about anybody. I just love you so much. I don't know how it happened, and frankly I don't even care. I just want to have you in my arms again, to love you, and to have you love me. I promise I'll love you forever and never leave you.This may be starting to sound like a poem, I don't know; it must be the rhythm of my heart that's calling for you. I just want to tell you and the world that you are in my heart and in my every thought. I love you with everything I have and hold dear. You mean more to me than anything, and I miss you so much. You're probably sleeping now, but when you wake up, this will greet you. I'm pouring my heart out to you in this letter. Can you feel how I feel for you now, my one and only love? You mean the world to me. I'll always be faithful and never leave you.I've done what I've wanted for so very long now--I've told you how I truly feel about you. But once I press this ""send"" button, you will know how deeply I love you, my angel. I'll hold you in my heart forever.",1
"I know you will never read this, but I want everyone to know that I love you with all my heart and soul. You make me feel like I can fly. I'm in love with you and, even though I am thousands of miles away from you, I am forever by your side.You have imperfections just like everyone else, I'm sure, but that is why I love you. You make me laugh; you make me cry tears of joy. I truly could not live my life without having you to talk to and to confide in. You know more about me than anyone now. You know my thoughts, you know my heart inside and out, and you have a way of making my heart skip a beat, too. I want you and the whole world to know that I love you and that I will be yours forever.Thank you for showing me what kind of love all women deserve, but most never have.",1
"The feelings of love that I hold in my heart for you run deeper than any ocean or sea. I just wish you could know how much you mean to me. If only you could hold me, then maybe you would feel my love and how it burns for you. If only you could hear my heart beat, then maybe you would understand the language of love it speaks to you. If only you could kiss me, then maybe you would taste my love for you. If only you could look into my eyes, the window to my soul, then you would know how true and honest my words are to you now!If you want me as your true love as much as I want you as mine, then let it be. I give you my heart and ask nothing more and nothing less than that you don't break it. My love and trust are all I have to give to you, sealed with honesty. As time goes by, may they grow stronger and fulfill whatever your heart may desire.If it pleases you, call me your love from this day forward, as I call you mine. I am your love and your best friend, too. As our bodies, minds, and souls combine, so do our hearts become one.Hear this, my declaration of love from me to you. I love you, my angel, with all my heart, and I will never stop loving you. You are my life; you are everything to me. Though distance may keep us apart for the moment, you are embedded deep within my heart.",1
"From the very first moment I saw you across the room, I knew you were my destiny. No man had ever captured my attention so fully or made my heart skip a beat the way it did that chilly February night. Your smile lit up the entire room, your laughter was delightfully contagious, and your mere presence warmed my heart and soul. I had no doubt you were the man God made especially for me.I want to thank you for that late night talk in the rain. You might have thought it was crazy then, but now you know it has ensured our future with an everlasting memory. Thank you for the conversation on the recliner in the sunroom and for asking me to be yours that night. Most importantly, thank you for falling in love with me and making me your wife. No matter how quickly our courtship passed, I know that standing before God and family and vowing to be your partner for life was the easiest decision I ever made.After only ten days as man and wife, we suddenly found ourselves divided by thousands of miles of sand and sea--separated by your service to our great nation and a war that could not wait. We've been apart for over seven months now. Each day that passes me by only makes my love for you grow stronger. Though we may struggle through our separation, please remember my love for you knows no boundaries and will continue to stretch across any ocean and over every grain of sand between us to get to you.I may be your wife, but you are my life. No war or distance can ever keep me from my destiny. I miss you so much, and I will be here with open arms when you come home to me where you belong.Loving you now and forever,",1
"I think of you all the time. You are so far away, yet so close in my heart. My heart and my body yearn for you. I love you unconditionally. I accept your daughter, who will become mine, and any other little ones that will come from us. For the first time I have purpose. For the first time I have found a family.I have read all about you and your zodiac sign and it is a good one. You are perfect for me. You excite me so much. I look forward to each day, so that I can come there and spend time with you. Last night I dreamed of you--I could picture you with me and it was so vivid. I hope I will always be yours. I am truly lucky to have found such a dear, sweet, loving person as you, an Aquarian, not just a woman, but a beautiful, sensual woman who arouses thoughts of such unbridled passion in me, and the desire to give myself to you completely. I remain yours forever. Time will pass and I know we will stay together.",1
"I know sometimes we fuss and fight. I know sometimes things don't go right. I know sometimes I can frustrate you, and sometimes you get me mad. I know that you're my better half. I know without you I'm incomplete and that tomorrow you won't be here with me, but you know that no matter what, you will always have a key to my heart.We might be miles away for a while. I might not get to hear you laugh, or even watch you sleep but, Darling, did you know that one true test of love is distance? It is said that distance brings people closer together.I know that even if I have to shed a tear every day until you come back, I will. If I have to hide myself from the world, I will. I will do anything I can just to make sure that when you come back to me you will know that my love is pure and true.",1
"You are a blessing that my entire being is thankful for. I feel that we were made to love, listen, understand, and work together through all the ups and downs in our lives. I know there are many more special occasions and moments that are coming to surprise us and bring us closer together.You are my soul mate and nothing and no one else feels more right for me than you do! I will love you eternally and unconditionally. I miss you more than words can say, and my love will reach any distance to be in your heart each day we cannot be together. I physically long for you each night and will see you in my dreams until we find ourselves wrapped in the love that grows stronger and deeper each day. I believe in you and have faith in you and in our future together.I Long to see you again.",1
"I am counting the days till you come back to me and you are in my arms again. The days seem longer than usual since you went overseas. I know that I should write only cheerful letters, and I will try. I do want you to know, however, that you are sorely missed. Your parents and I stay in touch. We talk about how we will welcome you home when your tour of duty ends.We all pray that you are kept safe from harm and get the mail and packages that we send you. I would like to wrap myself in a box and mail myself to you. Wouldn't that be fun?Stay safe and know that I love you with all my heart.",1
"I remember the day we met like it was only yesterday! You took my heart at a glance, and I knew you were the one I wanted to spend forever with. That smile of yours just put me in a daze. I am so happy I have you in my life. I couldn't ask for anything else in this entire world because I found all I ever wanted or needed in you! The times we shared together are times I will always cherish! I am looking forward to all the happy moments together we will have in the future!The day you had to leave to go overseas is also a day I will never forget, because that day, my love, you took with you my heart and soul. You looked at me with that smile on your face and promised everything would be fine--you said the Navy put us together and would keep us together until the end of time! We held each other tight with tears in our eyes. We didn't want to let go, but the time came to say goodbye. I hugged and kissed you and told you, ""I love you."" You held me so tight that day and looked into my eyes and said, ""I love you, and I will come back to you."" I got in our car and just sat there, and the tears wouldn't stop. I looked up from the steering wheel and surprise! You ran back to me! You kissed me one last time and said, ""Believe me, I will be back.""This is a cost I know I have to pay, my love. I know there will be other times you will have to go away, and the pain will not stop until I have you back by my side. Fight for our country, then hurry back home to your loving wife! I love you and I miss you!",1
"We all want you back again, safe and sound. You are serving your country, and I am proud of you for that.I miss your kisses and your arms around me. Every day I miss you more and more. I hope I can see you again soon, but until I do, I will keep you in my prayers and in my heart. Remember that I love you and that I always will. We are the lucky ones because we found each other again, and we are able to love each other more than we ever have before. I can't wait to see you again. It's only been a little over a week, but already I know that I cannot be away from you and from our love so long. I love you with all my heart!",1
"I wish I could speak to you every day, but the times you do call or when we get a letter are wonderful! Talking to you makes me feel good for at least a day or two afterwards, and I read your letters over and over again!I appreciate it when you try to cheer me up. There you are serving our country in the middle of shocking events and still you try to make me feel safe! You are unbelievable and so special! I will love you always.Please take care of yourself and don't worry about me.",1
I am really proud of everyone who is serving in the armed forces. It makes me feel good just to tell people that I know you. You and thousands of others who stepped forward to defend our nation are brave and honorable citizens.Please let me know if there is anything at all I can do for you here. I would be happy to visit your parents if you like. Just let me know. I am adding my email address and my cell phone number below if you ever get a chance to contact me.You know you are in my prayers.,1
"You have been overseas for a while now, and every day I miss you more. I hope you know the children and I love you very much.When you get another chance to read your email, you will be able to see pictures of your family. We love you and miss you here at home.After I call the children together to pray every night, first we look at the family picture we had taken before you left first. Then we fold our arms and ask God to protect you and bring you home soon.Please take care, my love. Everybody misses you here.",1
"Neither one of us expected to be separated this long. We knew you could be sent away to fight in that war, but neither one of us really thought it would happen. But now it has, and I am so lonely without you, but proud of you, too.I miss you very much, but the career you've chosen is an honorable one. I don't think there is anything more important or worthwhile than protecting your family and defending your country. I know you feel that way, too.We love you and miss you so very much.",1
"Oh, how I miss you, my wonderful sweetheart! The military has taken you far away from your home and from me. Yes, I do get lonely, but I think of how difficult it is for you there, and then I scold myself for being selfish.Please don't worry about me. I am okay. I want you to think only of taking care of yourself and of coming back home soon.I love you very much.",1
"You don't need to worry about me and the kids. We are fine except for missing you, and we will go on missing you until you come home again.I have my job to do here taking care of the children, and you have your job to do there, which is just as difficult.I worry about your commitment to defend our country during these difficult times, but I really am proud of you.The kids and I love you and miss you, so please take care of yourself.",1
"I realize that we can't be together, but I will be here for you when you return. In the meantime, I know that you are in God's hands and that He watches over you. I pray every day and night that He will always watch over you. I miss talking to you and listening to your voice. I miss your hugs, your kisses, and your sweet ways of showing how much you love me. I have never been in love with anyone the way I am in love with you. I feel free when I am near you. You let me be me and make me feel so special.I know God has something good in store for us, because He is a loving God. When we are in each other's arms again, He will shower us with His incredible love.I miss you and our children miss you, too. Our son and daughter talk about their Dad every day. We include you in our nightly prayers, which we say with your photograph nearby. We all talk about how we will shower you with hugs and kisses when you come home. We sometimes argue over who will run up to you first when we see you at the station. We all agree that we will spoil you and never allow you to be out of our sight.With God watching over you, we know that you are in the best of hands.",1
"I love you from now until death do us part. Right now, you are living so far away from me I feel it is killing me, but I know in my heart that we are doing the right thing. You are just trying to get things straight so we can live there forever and spend a lifetime together. I want you to know that I love you from the depths of my heart. My love for you is unconditional. My love for you is so strong and the most powerful feeling that I have had in a long time. I am just at a loss for the right words when it comes to you. I just wish there was another way that we could be together without living so far apart now. I want you to know that I love you and always will. There is nothing that will ever change how I feel about you. I love you--I truly do.",1
"I went to bed last night with a vision of you next to me. I slept like a log all night because I felt you were with me. When I awoke this morning to see if it were real or a dream, reality hit me that it was only a dream. Very soon, though, I know you will really be right next to me, and that I will not have to only dream of it again because you will be right there so we can hold, hug and squeeze each other tight. I long to be there with you now, so that I can help build and support your life there, and so that we can accomplish a lot together as husband and wife.",1
"Though the miles separate us, the bond we have is far stronger. You are the very one I have spent all these years looking for. You make me smile. You make me laugh. You make me whole. I cannot describe the giddy feeling I have when you are near or even when you just cross my mind. I am so amazingly happy and content when I'm with you, I want to spend forever in your life, in your world, in your family, and in your arms.",1
"You came into my life not too long ago, and I didn't think too much of it. We were friends and we got along well, but I never imagined I'd be falling so hard for you. The more I got to know you, the more often I wanted to be with you. You always made me smile, and without you I was very different. You changed me in so many ways. I wanted to wake up in the morning to see what life was going to throw at me each and every day. After we became closer and were talking all the time, you told me you had to leave. You had to go back home, and you couldn't stay any longer.That night I thought about telling you what lay within my heart, but I decided not to. Your friendship meant so much more to me. You are coming back to visit soon, and I can't help but think about you all the time now. Every morning when I wake up, then during the day, and before I go to sleep, you are always on my mind and even in my dreams. I wish you knew how strongly I felt and that I am falling in love with you.One day I will tell you, but for now I will only see you in my dreams and hold you close to my heart. I love you so much. I can't wait to see you again!",1
"Where would I be if I hadn't met you? I'll tell you where--I would still be lonely, looking for that special someone to make me smile again. We found each other at just the right time. If I had met you earlier in life, I don't think I could have appreciated you as much as I do now. Everything that I have been through in the past year has only prepared me to meet you.The distance that is between us now is only going to make our love stronger, so there is less of a chance that we will take each other for granted. The weeks that we are apart, I look forward to the day that we will be together again. I am already looking forward to the next time that I get to see your handsome face.The love that we share is never-ending and powerful. I thank God every day that someone loves me as much as you do. It is a once in a lifetime thing! I love you and the way you make me feel. I love you with all my heart and soul. The great thing is, I know you love me just as much as I love you, and your love is true and not to be taken lightly.",1
"Honey, you have changed my life completely. You're the one who makes me beautiful. You're the one who makes me strong. You're the one who makes my life so important. You're everything to me.You show your love to me every day and even every minute when we are chatting. How lucky I am to find a man like you. Thank God above for us! Honey, please forgive me for not being able to spend enough time chatting with you now, but I promise I will compensate for it one day with the thing that you want the most. You know what I think that is? A family. A family that belongs to us; a family who we can share our ups and our downs with, who we can stay together with till we die. Honey, that's the best I can give you. I hope it is what you want the most.I really wish that you were near me, and when I need help, you could appear and help me. I want to do the same for you, too, but knowing that you love me is enough and, if I can be your wife and your children's mom, then this would make me proud for the rest of my life. Remember, you need to take care of all of us, so you've got to take good care of yourself too. Ti Amo tesoro mio, you're the only one that I want.",1
"Happy anniversary! I'm writing this letter to remind you that I love you. I know that things have been a bit hard for us lately, and we have both hurt each other, but I really do believe that it will be okay now.I love you more than I can say. You are the most important thing in the world to me, and I would do anything for you. You make my life complete and I am only happy when we are together.I know that we can't be near each other at the moment, but if we just put up with being apart for a bit longer, it will all work out, and it'll be worth it in the end. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want us to grow old together. I hope this is only the beginning.",1
"Remember, our love is the link that holds our two hearts together. If I could put into words how you make me feel when I think of you, and how much you excite me when I hear your sweet voice, I would be talking forever! You're all that I need and want, Honey. I live for the day that I can sit next to you and whisper into your ear and tell you that I love you, and kiss you ever so lightly, but passionately, on your lips, and to look into your beautiful eyes as you take my breath away. I live for that first look into your eyes, that first passionate kiss, that first embrace, and that first time that we make love together. I live to love, to spend a lifetime with you as your wife and to grow old with you, loving you for all time, from now to eternity. I love to love you.",1
"What further words can describe what we have together? For our love to grow as it has this past year, I fed it with every beat of my heart. Words can no longer describe it, only the feeling and emotion we have for each other can express it now. You have always had the key to my heart, and your spirit inside my heart has made me more than I can ever be. Though the sea separates us till that special day, I know we take each breath together with every beat of our hearts. I love you with all that I am.",1
"Our love started over the Internet and everything seemed almost perfect then. We had never met, but the love we felt was so big and true, even then, and could only become complete by meeting each other.The very first day I saw you in person, we said, ""hello,"" immediately felt the thrill of that love and held one another so tightly. We didn't want to let go, and time stood still. We had a perfect day, and we knew it could only get better and better if we held, kissed, and hugged one another. After that moment, we never went through a day without saying how much we loved and needed each other and would for the rest of our lives.Being far away from you is difficult. Not sharing every day with you and not being able to hold you whenever I want hurts so much, but I know that at the end of all this pain, I will find you again. You stood by my side when things were good, and when they were bad, you listened and hugged me saying, ""Everything's gonna be okay."" And it was.I know we'll have a great life together, and I can't wait for us to be with each other every day now, sharing everyday problems and joy, without having to leave one another's side. Fate is putting us through this, but we'll come out of it all shining, as the love we feel for each other is hard to find.I'm proud of the person you are. I love the way you treat me and everyone else. I'm proud to be with someone like you, the sweetest and most caring guy I've ever known. Don't ever change, Honey, as you're perfect--we're perfect for each other and it will be like this for the rest of our lives.",1
"I am just writing you to let you know how much I love you. We have many miles separating us, but I know we'll make it through. You mean the world to me, and no one can ever compare to you. I think about you all the time, and wake up thinking of you and go to sleep thinking of you. Your name repeats over and over in my mind. Your very name, Matthew, means ""gift of the Lord,"" as you have actually been to me. Each day my love grows stronger, so I know my love for you will never fade. These miles between us won't fade either, but I know that our love will keep us together. It's so odd for us to be so far away from each other, but yet so close in spirit. I love you, Babe.",1
"The sadness I have is really indescribable. Your moving so far away because of business is the worst thing that could have happened to us. It is as though a large wedge was put between me and the person that I care for the most. I am fighting the existence of this great distance between us, and it strikes me hard because I miss you so very much. Not seeing you often and knowing you are many hours, not minutes away, breaks my heart. I don't like the distance and just thinking of the many days before we see one another again makes me cry.I write this so that you can read it when you, too, feel lonely. I love you with all my heart and soul. All that I am, I owe to you. You are with me in spirit every moment of each day, and I hope that you feel my loving presence where you are.",1
"When we first met, I didn't even consider that you were real. You were just a pixel on a screen. We talked more, and then I became confused. ""How I could I have real feelings for a person I've never met?"" I'd ask myself. Since then we have met. I will never forget the first time I looked into your eyes, and it was at that very moment I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. In your eyes, I saw everything I needed to know. It's been seven months now. Things have not been easy. We've had our ups and downs but, through it all, I do know what we have is so very real.",1
"Although we've never met, I feel as if I know you well. I knew from the start that there was something special about you; you touched my heart and haven't let go of it. Our relationship has given me a lot of dreams, and now I feel hope. You entered my thoughts and magically erased all of my fears with your sweet and caring ways. Now I look forward to each day and feel so much at ease with you. I'm so grateful that we're able to share our problems and aspirations with each other. It truly seems as if you're a part of me now, as if our time together was a union of souls. The thought of you fills me with smiles, and I can't wait to hug you each day.",1
"Being apart from you again is like feeling death in slow motion. I think of how things could have been, if only we had gotten married. But what can we do about it now? Pray for peace. I'm lost without you and can't think about anything but what our destiny could be. Suddenly, I close my eyes and imagine your hands caressing my face, fearing that you'll feel the tears running down my cheeks. I know you're hurting as much as I am, but I don't want you to feel sorry for me. I love you, and I'm not sorry for loving you. You have given me so much happiness, and I know you love me now in your own great way. I miss you so much, and the fear of losing you is driving me crazy. Don't let our love die because of the distance, nor let our faith fade away. I'm waiting for you to come back to my arms, and make the sun shine once again on these stormy times.",1
"I know we don't get to talk much anymore, but being in Florida doesn't change the way I feel about you in my heart. Sure, I'm lonely, and sometimes I'm overwhelmed with this emptiness in my heart. But I love you--that's what gets me through every minute that I'm without you. You don't know what I would give to kiss your lips, feel your touch, or even just to be near you.I don't care if you forget our first kiss or our first date, just as long as you remember that I love you with every aching bone in my body, and always will.",1
"From Day 1, I knew there was something in you that no other guy has. I had always searched for a blonde-haired, blue-eyed man, and dreamt of having a fairytale wedding. Well, you don't have blonde hair or blue eyes--but I think you're perfect! From your gorgeous smile to your warm, loving eyes and strong arms.I was scared to love you after everyone said we wouldn't even make it for two weeks, but we did, so what do they know? After we passed those first two weeks, I knew there was something that just worked between us. We made it through the best 10 months of my life, and then that's when you left. Now you are 2000 miles away and I can't be with you until June. Although these will be the hardest months of my life, I would wait forever to be in your arms again. Once again, we have people saying that there's no way we will make it through this, but I think we can prove them wrong once more.I live for you, and only you. I dream of the day that I can be your wife. I want so badly for that dream of mine to come true; you have no idea. When we talk about getting married and having kids together, my heart melts. I know that I'm young--younger than you--and you want what's best for me, but I know in my heart that you are the best thing that has ever and will ever happen to me.You have taught me so much about myself and the way that I should live my life. You have taught me things that will eventually help me grow into the type of person I need to be, and you have taught me to love without holding back. You have been my ""sweetest sin"" since the beginning.My parents didn't want us to last, some ""friends"" didn't want us to last, but you have no idea what it's like to be me when I get to feel your hands caressing my body. It's the feeling I get being that close to you, the feeling that I am the safest person in the world. I love you! You are the one for me, but you know that already, and I'll say this until I turn blue in the face: Marry me! You know I don't even mean right now, just some day! I love you!",1
"I long for the day that we can meet face to face. I know it's only been a week since we met online, but I feel like I've known you forever.Every time I chat with you, my heart skips a beat, and you take my breath away. I love you so much already, and we haven't even met in person. I understand that you have a very important job to do but, when I don't get to chat with you, I feel so empty. I miss you so much.I long for the first time that you will hold me in your arms. I know it will be an experience that we both will enjoy and cherish for the rest of our lives. I want to spend the rest of my life with you and no one else.Every time your name is mentioned, my face lights up, and I get a smile on my face bigger than Dallas. I know us being apart like this is a challenge for the both of us. God is seeing if we can make it, even though we are apart. If we can stay together until we can really be together, then there will be no one who will ever be able to separate us. I love you with all my heart and soul.I am so glad my friend introduced us to each other. I had a good feeling come over me when I first saw you on my computer screen. You are a very handsome man. You take my breath away every time I see you, and I feel deep down that this relationship is going to work. You promised me that you would never hurt me, so I am going to hold you to that promise.Love is a very powerful word. When you tell someone that you love them, you have to truly mean it from the bottom of your heart. I have this feeling that you really, truly mean it from the bottom of your heart.You are the best thing that has ever come into my life. I have been hurt so many times in the past that it takes a lot for me to trust someone now. The first time I saw you, I had this gut feeling that you and I were going to be together for a very long time. I love you. Please don't ever leave me. I hope I'm not over-burdening you with all these lovey dovey talk, but I do love you, and I need to tell you that. You have me forever if you want me. Thank you so much for coming into my life.",1
"The day we met is the day I will never forget. Over and over I replay our first online chat and then our first telephone conversation in my mind! You are so amazing, you drive me crazy! You make me feel so happy and complete. If I hadn't met you, I know I'd still be searching--searching for you!Ever since that special day, we have both grown in such a special way. Although I don't say it as often I want to, I want to tell you that I want you, I need you, and I love you. Thank you for all the beautiful e-mails you've sent me, all the wonderful gifts you've mailed me, and all the sweet words you seem to say at the right moment and in the right place.You have the key to my heart and one day, when we meet, we will never, ever be separated again! To finally kiss your tender lips, to feel your gentle touch, to look into those soft brown eyes and know you are the one I have been waiting for! I love you, Karl! ""Ich liebe dich.""I am yours and only yours.",1
"It has almost been one and a half years since I had the honor of holding you in my arms, and it has been one and a half years since we looked into each other's eyes and said, ""I love you.""What started out as a sincere friendship turned into a strong bond between two lovers who found out the true meaning of love the hard way. The journey seems so long, sometimes, and at the same time it seems so short. To me it feels like time is purposely bending and stretching itself so that it can play its part in making us feel the joy and pain of what it is to truly be in a long-distance relationship. All I know is, as time goes by, I learn a lot from this love, and I have learned what it is like to give myself completely to another person when the two of us are so far apart. The most important thing I learned, among many important things, was to trust and to be faithful to the one I love.I just got done chatting with you on the Internet after you had signed on to say ""good night,"" but in my heart I did not want to do that--say ""good night,"" that is. I just wish that time had frozen that short time before we had to say those words. I enjoyed every single moment with you, and how we talked about all of the things we liked and disliked. Tonight you told me how you liked the music CD your brother bought for you, and you asked me what music groups I liked, too. I really wish I could have been there to hear that music with you.I am sitting here in my room and writing this message now, hoping you will get to read it when you come back from work later if you go online, but if not, then at least I know this letter will reach you sooner or later. I am listening to some love songs that I burned onto a CD I'm making. Although I don't understand the words because the songs are in Spanish, I know that they are about love, and I like them a lot. I really don't understand how my love works, but all I know is that the love I have for you is just like the Spanish music I am listening to now. I know that my life is much happier when you're around me and that my life is filled with music just thinking about you.I want to let you know that I am so in love with you, and I have learned a lot from this relationship. I promise you that I will do my best to make you feel loved and secure, even though there are thousands of miles between us.Thank you for making my life so much more meaningful and giving me this chance to tell you what love means to me. I know that I am supposed to go to sleep soon, but there is so much more I want to tell you, and I am still so wound up. Being away from you is so hard for me because it is like giving up a part of my life that is essential to me.I have built my world around you, and I really like the world that we have built together. I always want to stay in that world and never want to leave it, and I hope that you feel the same way, too.Now is the hardest part for me to do. I have to say ""goodbye"" and ""goodnight,"" because I need to go to sleep soon. But I know that as soon as I close my eyes I will be there with you, and it makes me so happy again. I love you with all my heart, and I want you to know that I really miss you. Please take care and have a nice day tomorrow. May you feel me wanting to be with you now, and may I touch your heart and let you feel my love. Take care, Lisa, and know that I am sending all my love to you across the miles.",1
"When we first met, I didn't even suspect what a wizard you were about to be. But apparently life can show us such wonders that we can stay amazed like children, wondering how this could happen to us! Well, I want to thank you for being my best friend, for being my angel, for being my soul, for being my life! I want you to know that I haven't received anything sweeter than this letter you sent me:""I have never felt like this before. Nobody has taken me so high, except you, my princess from the clouds. You brighten my days and give me the strength to carry on, fighting every day to be with you. You revealed the deepest emotions and feelings I've kept inside of me for so long. Feelings I didn't even suspect existed.But most of all, you showed me the real taste of love. You are my best friend and the one I want for life, my yesterday, my today, and my tomorrow. You are the one I love, and I want everybody to know it! I love you more than anything.Every song you send me to express your feelings, every single word you write becomes a part of my soul, as if I had already known what you were about to say. Every step I make is safe because you are around me now.",1
"We were meant to be together for the rest of our lives--this we know. Each day that passes, I am aware that it means one day closer to being in your arms again. Each night is spent dreaming of your face and wishing you were next to me again. Right now you are in dangerous circumstances, but I know you are being careful. I love you with more than just my heart; I love you with my entire being. This distance is just an inconvenience, meeting you was fate.",1
"While I lay here waiting to hear from you, I can't help but think how my life changed when you became a part of it. All that I envision for us being together has been the focus of my thoughts every day, knowing that one day everything will finally happen.You give me reason to wake up in the morning and smile. Just smile for no particular reason, except for the fact that you are coming here. As the days go by, I feel myself growing closer and closer to you, and my heart is slowly coming out of its shy corner and feeling what it feels like to be loved again. I don't ever want to lose this feeling. I don't ever want to lose you.When I hear your voice, it gives me comfort and joy. Those are feelings I don't want to let go of. The sound of your voice is like my favorite love song. I can listen to it all evening until it puts me to sleep. Still as I continue to lay here and think about everything you are to me, I can't help but wonder, what's on your mind, too? How much do you feel, and how real do you think our love actually is?I just want you to know that wherever this road may take us, and how far it may be to finally get where we want to go, you are in my heart, and in my heart is where you'll always be. Life wasn't this kind to me until there was you. Thank you for being you. What I'd like to say next, I wish I could say to you in person.You have all my love.",1
"Never in my wildest dreams did I ever believe this could ever happen. I never expected to fall so deeply in love so fast. It all started last week with your first email to me: ""Call me, we need to talk!"" I was just online trying to catch up with some friends, and I had the pleasure of seeing your email message in my mailbox. I wanted to wait a few days before calling you, but my heart had other plans. So I called you a few hours later and that was the beginning of this love affair to remember.I remember we talked for hours about anything and everything. When you asked me to come to NYC to visit, I was scared at first, but again my heart spoke for me. I decided to take a chance and see what would happen, but I never expected we would say we loved each other even before we met in person. Now don't get me wrong--I believe in love at first sight, but I thought I would be the last person to be bitten by that bug. When you surprised me with a dozen long-stemmed roses last Wednesday, however, I received a confirmation that had been in my heart since Sunday--that I loved you. When you said, ""I love you,"" it gave me a little tingle in the pit of my stomach. Something I had never felt before.When we saw each other Thursday night for the first time, I knew you were real and not just a dream that I hoped would come true. The time we spent together in NYC was magical and so romantic that I never wanted it to end. When you asked me to move to NYC, how could I say, ""No""? When you said you wanted me to be your wife, how could I say, ""no""? Even though we live apart right now, I have faith that in due time this will all come to an end, and we will be together forever. I love you more than words could ever show, and I know you love me too. Like the saying goes, ""Distance makes the heart grow fonder."" Well, my heart has always been and will continue to be quite fond of you. I love you more today than yesterday, and I will love you more tomorrow than I do today!",1
"I love you from now until death do us part. Right now, you're living so far away that it is killing me, but I know in my heart that we are doing the right thing. You are trying to get things straight, so we can spend a lifetime together and live there forever. I don't want to lose you to anyone else or because of anything that anyone has to say about you. I want you to know that I love you from the depths of my heart, and my love for you is unconditional. My love for you is so strong and the most powerful feeling that I have had in a long time that I am at a loss for words to tell you so. I just wish that there was another way that we could be together without living so far apart at the time being. I want you to know that I love you and always will, and there is nothing that will ever change how I feel about you. I love you.All my love, now and forever.",1
"I love you from now until death do us part. Right now, the fact that you are living so far away from me is hard, but I know in my heart that we are doing the right thing. Also, you are trying to get things straight so we can live there forever and spend a lifetime together. I don't want to lose you to anyone else or because of anything that anyone has to say about our life.I want you to know that I love you from the deepest part of my heart. My love for you is unconditional. My love for you is so strong and the most powerful feeling that I have ever had. I am just at a loss for the right words when it comes to you. I just wish that there was another way that we could be together without living so far apart right now. I want you to know that I love you and always will, and there is nothing that will ever change how I feel about you--I love you.",1
"I know that you will be surprised when you find out that I wrote this love letter to you. It's the first time that I have written one, so please forgive me if I am not clearly expressing myself. We have known each other from the net for more than half a year now, and we have been in love for two months and nine days--but who's counting? I am so glad that you remembered the first day that I told you, ""I love you."" It's so sweet. I love you, Darling.You have been the one who filled my days and nights when we were having our holiday, and sometimes when you were not available to chat with me, I couldn't sleep that night. You're so important to me. I know these days I am really busy touring, and when I don't have any time to chat with you, please forgive me. It's so hard not to be able to write something to you every day. I want you to know that I always care about you, and you're always in my heart. I want the whole world to know that I love you and that I really care about you. It's open to everyone to see my love for you.I know that it's very hard for both of us to maintain this long distance relationship, but I believe that we can do it. I will wait for that day to come when we are no longer apart. I know it's a bit long for us to wait, but it's worth waiting for, right?I don't know if this can be counted as a love letter or not. I don't know how to use words to express feelings to you that are so hard to express in words, but remember that when you close your eyes, you can feel my love for you, and I will always be there in your heart. I love you, Luigi, and I will always love you. You are my only love, so there's only you in my life. Remember our song? It's always going to be our theme song--""Endless Love.""",1
"I always thought that dreams were just dreams, but you made them all come true and even better, you built new dreams with me! I cannot thank you enough for being more than perfect because you showed me that even all the things that seem wrong are actually opportunities to work at them together and bring us closer together. No matter how far you are and no matter what you do, I always want you to know how much you mean to me, and how much I truly love you and how much I will always be yours forever.I love you so much and wish I could be there to hug and kiss you all day and all night long, but for now, this love letter will have to be my message. Please know that you are a big part of me and I think of you all the time. I love you, and I've loved you before I was born, because I believe I was made for you, and will be yours for all eternity.",1
"My love, you are so far and yet so nearby. You are many miles and many moons away, and I get lonely just thinking of the distance between us, yet in my heart you are just a beat away. When I feel blue, I picture you with me on a moon-lit night, holding hands and planning our great future together. I think of the good times to come when I will be embraced by your love. I will be patient, my love, because I know good things come to those who wait. Until then, I will love you, anticipating when you will arrive.",1
"I'm pretty sure you are safe, because I'm always praying for you. I couldn't really believe that even in my wildest dream that things like these could ever happen to us. I never realized before that just one click of the mouse could really change my life. And I never expected to fall so deeply in love, so fast, with you. What's your magic? How pleased I am to be a meaningful part of your life. I'll always be in love with you--only with you.I know we can't get together right now; we are just too far apart, and I perfectly understand that. But somehow, I still have faith that in due time, this will all come to an end, and we will be together forever. Being far away from you is not that easy. It's getting harder and is starting to drive me crazy and make me think about you, more and more. Although we're apart now, I can assure you that it doesn't change the way I feel about you. You're such a blessing to me. Thank you for everything, for loving me. I mean it.And one more thing--I really appreciate you. Maybe you are too smart to fall in love with me, but I guess I am much smarter than you are because I let myself fall in love with you so deeply.",1
"It's funny, because I told myself I would never fall in love again. Yet when I was the least expecting it, I fell the hardest (our second date in the park). I finally found my true soul mate. I know that the next year or so will be very hard on our relationship. I've been thinking about that a lot these past few weeks. The more I think about it, though, the more I know I have made the right choice. No matter what coming trials we may yet face, I will never give up on our love.I once was told that if you really love someone, then everything would work out just fine in the end, and that if our love was strong, we could make it through anything. Lately, I have realized that is what true love is all about. I want you to know that while you are gone, I will be completely faithful to you. Honey, you will NEVER have to worry about that. I know without a single doubt that God brought us together, and we were just meant to be. I love you and I will forever!",1
"You have no idea how long I've dreamed of the day when we could be together again. You truly can not imagine how hard this situation is for me. I've longed to be with you for years, but never really had the guts to do anything about it. That was until you actually approached me and from then on, I have been in love--not a crush, not puppy love, but true, honest-to-goodness love. The kind of love that somehow transforms you from one of those people who think that everyone else gets everything, to one of those people who is convinced they actually have it all.Honey, I guess what I'm trying to say is that before you, it seemed that I had nothing, and now I feel I have everything. It is all due to you and you alone. Well, I should probably tell you now that I love you and miss you and that this has got to be harder than anything I have ever done--feeling so close to you, yet being so far away.This is really hard for me because what I want to say is--pray for me and that this war will be over soon, so we can have peace, and so I can come home to you.",1
"If only I could have come up with the right words to describe the depth of this beautiful feeling that I have for you, I would have uttered them to you the first time I laid eyes on you. But I lacked that knowledge, so the best thing that I can do is to show you how I really mean it now. I love you so dearly. Did you know that? You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. You are like the best poetry ever composed, the best song ever played, the best picture ever painted. I never thought or expected that someone like me could get so lucky as to find you. How could I have known the comfort and security that comes whenever I say ""I love you,"" and you say the same words, too?I know that you love me, or you wouldn't have married me. Marrying me was just among the many wonderful things you have done to show me that you are sincere and how much I mean to you. I love you more than life itself--more than my world. You are my world. Life wouldn't be life if I didn't share it with you. We may be far away from each other right now, but my heart and my love can reach across any distance, and I feel your love reaching me here, too. It just feels so wonderful knowing and believing that. Aren't we lucky? I love you--more and more each day.",1
"When my sky turns gray, and the thunder starts to roll, and it seems as if tomorrow will never come, I turn to you. The look in your eyes, the touch of your hands, the sound of your voice--it's all I need to brighten my day and blow the rainy clouds away. You are my angel from above, sent to me. Why? I do not know, but what I do know is that I don't deserve it. When I look into your eyes and feel your gentle touch, it sends chills up my spine, sending me into an ecstasy beyond explanation.Babe, you drive me wild! Just the way you look in my eyes sends my head spinning and the stars start to shine. The sound of your voice starts my heart pumping so, Babe, you can only imagine what it's like when you wrap your arms around me and I feel your warm breath on my cheek. You make my body shiver in bliss, my breath is taken away, I see the stars, Babe, and it's all because of you. It's amazing how you knock me off my feet; every time you come around me, I get weak.Dream maker, make my dreams come true tonight! If I close my eyes, will you hold me tight all night? Will you be here by my side when my nights are cold and lonely? Will you give me your love that I crave so deeply? I cannot imagine my life without you now. You are everything inside me that I wish I could be and so much more. I look at my life before I knew your love, and I don't know how I ever survived.As I said before, you are my angel, my miracle. I never knew that someone like you was out there, just waiting for me to find her. Well, I did find you, Babe, and now that I have you, I will never let you go!Babe, just confide in me your deepest feelings, tell me your fantasies, and they shall all be fulfilled. I will do anything it takes to make you happy because that is the only thing that matters to me anymore. You are perfect in my eyes, and there is absolutely nothing that I would ever change about you. I know that no one can be perfect but you, Babe, in my eyes, are as perfect as anyone could be. It leaves me amazed, yet blessed, to have found someone as special as you are.Babe, I'm going to be sitting here waiting; waiting for your phone call and then waiting for the day I will actually see you. A little distance between us is going to drive me crazy, but I know it'll all work out just fine. Till then, I will just be waiting for the day when we will actually be together.I love you.Hugs, misses, and butterfly kisses,",1
"You are so far away, and every day I wish you were here with me, holding me tight in your strong arms. Every night I lay in bed dreaming of you, sweet and peacefully. You are the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. Missing you so much is breaking my heart. I need you to come back to me, my love. I love you more than anything in this world. I want to walk on the beach with you; then it would be so peaceful and romantic just to sit together and watch the sun as it sets.Being with you makes me happy. You keep me alive and vibrant. I'm so lucky I found you, the man of my dreams. I hope I never lose you. If I did, it would break my heart. Thinking of you makes me smile because knowing that you love me means the world to me. You're sweet, like the smell of roses, and you're romantic, like the sunset.I am feeling down right now, and your love is all that is keeping me strong. I love you so much. I can wait to be with you physically for just another day, but not forever.",1
"Since you came into my life, I have been so happy. The fact that we're a thousand miles apart is not a problem at all because you are always in my heart. You told me that I'm the right one, and I cannot tell you how good that made me feel. I am waiting for the days to come that will make our dreams come true. I'll wait for you for a lifetime if you want me to. Do you know why? Because you are the only one who sees me when I am invisible to others. I hope you never quit believing that my love for you is true.",1
"You brought love and laughter to my sad, empty, and meaningless existence. My life had been boring until the day you came and filled my heart to overflowing with your sense of humor. You turned my frown into a smile.You taught me how to love again. You taught me to give and receive love by trusting in you and believing in us. You taught me to go the extra mile and, though there are miles between us, I never stop thinking about you. You brought a great change into my life, and my heart is yours forever.I can never forget you or keep thoughts of you out of my mind. I think of your sweet lips and kisses; feel them as if you were here. Thoughts of you warm my heart. You complete me and are everything my heart desires.",1
"I could kiss you a thousand times and still not be satisfied. My love for you is endless, and so tender, and so complete. I love you more and more with each passing day, and it eases my mind to know as tomorrow approaches, that I will love you more tomorrow than yesterday, and tomorrow I will love you more than today. My love for you cannot even be expressed in words, but only when we are together and you are holding me tight.When I think of our love, it reminds me of all the things you mean to me. You and only you have given me so much hope and have made me realize how much I need you, too. You show the true meaning of how a man should treat a woman.Rodney, please accept my heart as your own and listen to both of our hearts beating as one. You are my reason to live. Without you, I am nothing. The years will be a test, but nothing will keep me from loving you, or from being by your side. I love you more than you could ever know; you are my world. I just want to let you know how much I love all that you are and will grow to be. You are truly my love, my soul mate, and my best friend.For the first time in my life, I have something to believe in. You've seen me at my worst and still take me as I am. I thank God for you every day because I know you are an angel who is heaven sent. I love you from now till death do us part.Right now you live far away from me and it's killing me, but I know in my heart that we will make it through this. I don't want to lose you to anyone else or to anything that anyone has to say about me. I want you to know I love you from the deepest part of my heart. I'm always so lost for words when it comes to you. I just wish there was another way that we could be together.I want you and always will. There is nothing that will ever change the way I feel about you. I love you! Love can make a person do things that they never thought possible. There's a place in me where your fingerprints still rest, your kisses still linger, and your whispers softly echo. It's the place where a part of you will forever be a part me. I promise that you will always be in my heart. I love you.",1
"We immediately connected in a way that lifted us above all else. It was so passionate, yet so spiritually uplifting--that's what ""making love"" is all about. It's spiritual, yet passionate at the same time. That intellectual, genuine, true appreciation for one another that we've had since we first met was the purest form of affection I have ever experienced. Now it's gone, at least for now.I have always been a very strong person but, as you can plainly see, I am hopelessly lost, like a little child that's been alone too long. On occasion, though, I can hear you in the house and, for a moment, like the poet said, ""All's right with the world."" I haven't thanked you lately for shining that light on my life.Your ghost keeps me company for a few seconds every once in a while. I wake up in the morning, and hear you in the kitchen, or in the shower, or I can smell your perfume, but it's just the ghost again. But I thank God every time I feel it, because when I am apart from my one and only soul mate, I learn to appreciate the little things we shared, even more than before.I believe that neither one of us really knew what true love could be until we met, nor what real passion was before we made love for the first time. We will make it through this now; we just have to trust one another enough not to be afraid of how overwhelming our challenges can be.You are my sunrise and sunset, every single day. You are my heart and soul--never have I met anyone with your kind spirit and loving heart. I am truly sorry if I have ever let an opportunity slip by without letting you know how special you were.I will love you always.",1
"I feel like the luckiest person on earth because you said that you love me. Those words sent me flying, my head spinning, and all I can think of is you and when we meet again. On that day, I promise to cover you with caresses--and so many kisses that you will know of the love I have for you. My loving you will be something you will want to have forever.How lucky am I? You are the most beautiful woman I have ever known. You are perfect in every way. You are special and kind and lovely, and I could not ask for more because there is nothing more that I would want or need.We will be together soon. I count the hours.Your lover!",1
"You can never ever know how I treasure the words in your last letter. You say that I have enriched your life and made you feel special. These words I will hold in my heart, which is already bursting with the joy I have felt since we have been together.I miss you more than I ever thought I could miss anyone. That is no surprise to me, because I love you more than I ever thought possible. Somewhere I read that distance makes the heart grow fonder. That may be true for some, but for me, every moment, whether away from you or with you, makes me love you more. Every moment of my life is enriched because you love me and I love you.We have to be patient for a little longer. I am forever yours.",1
"I've loved you since the day we met in the Philippines. Then I lost you, and now I have found you again. You are everything to me. I have not let a day go by without thinking of you.I have not stopped loving you since the day we met again after more than 30 years of separation, with me missing you and wanting you by my side. Now, every day is a new day for us, especially when you leave home and give me a goodbye kiss before you go off to work, then return in the evening to my open arms.While you are at work, I am writing these few lines to tell you how I felt in then, and how I still feel NOW about you. I love you!",1
"I know we have been through a lot in the past ten months. With our daughter being in an accident and us separated at the time, we needed to be without pride in our way. I have loved you since the day I laid eyes on you. And I know that no one is perfect. I just hope you remember that also. But no matter what, we have learned so much from each other. Our love has survived so many trials. From selling our dream home to seeing two children in the hospital. Through it all you have always remained in my heart. You make me whole and complete. I never want to take our love for granted again.We wasted too much time already being separated for so long. You have and always will have my heart and soul. I am yours for the long haul. I know at times you get angry, but that doesn't outweigh the times you want to kiss me. I am writing this letter to make a promise to you that I am going to try as hard as I can for us this time, as long as you will have me. It's so rare what we have. I would hate to lose such a beautiful person in my life; who not only is the love of my life, but a love I never really thought could exist for me. You are my soul--if you only knew. Without that, I can't really live, at least happily. I love you and always have.",1
"I will always regret the day that I broke up with you. You mean so much to me. You're my world, my love, and my best friend. I remember those days walking in the park. Those days were the best days that I've ever had in my life. Each day, I walk down to that park and sit on the bench that we would always sit on. I would sit there and soon sadness would overcome me, and. I would start to cry because I had lost you. I know that you would never come back to me because you're afraid that I might hurt you again, but that's not true. I would never hurt you ever again if you just give me another chance.",1
"Two years have passed, but I will never forget how we first met. I was standing there at the department store when you walked past me with a wide smile on your face. A minute later, you sent me a note, on the back of which you wrote your telephone number. I was seeing someone else then, but I felt my heart skip a beat when I saw your smiling face. I'll never forget the conversation we had then. Although you're not much of a talker, your presence alone is enough to make my day. You claimed that I was your ""love at first sight.""As the days passed, I realized that it was wrong to try to be in love with two women at the same time. Upon knowing my consciousness, you withdrew yourself. I still remember that painful moment. There were tears in my eyes, but you just walked away without turning back. I never heard from you since that day, nor even bumped into you anywhere. After a year and a half, I still have feelings for you.My other relationship didn't work out, and I was hoping that I might find you. ""Miracles do happen,"" people say, but I didn't believe it until I saw your face one day, but now, at last, we're together! I just want the whole world to know how much you mean to me. You are everything to me. I lost you before; I don't want to lose you again. Till now, I always asked myself, ""Could this be real? Is he the ONE for me?"" The positive answers to my questions are in your hands. I have faith in you and never will I give that up. Without your love, I'd be half a being. Maybe one day you will understand. Now and forever, until the end of time, I love you.",1
"Things are hard right now, and they seem to just be a big blurry mess. But I don't blame you for any of it. I know this is both our faults so I don't expect you to say or do anything. I know that we are trying to fix all the screwed up things in our lives right now, and I hope we do get to make everything as good as it was before. I am only truly happy when I am with you. Your presence just lights up my world. Everything I am and everything I have is dependent upon you.I am sorry for the way I have mistreated you in the past, and I know you are sorry for mistreating me. We can be happy together again if we work everything out, and I know we can. You are everything to me and I love you with all my heart. I hope I can learn to open up to you and let you know how I feel. I also hope that you will be able to recognize when something is wrong. But no matter what we do or where we go, I will love you. I will always love you, Baby. You mean the world to me. I hope we can fix everything and go back to the way we were.",1
"Baby, I can't even begin to tell you how much I miss you--your fragrance, your laughter, the way you do things. I want more than anything to get our love back together, to see you happily smiling and, most of all, to have you proud to stand beside me again. I've hurt you so much, and I am so very sorry for that pain. I want to be the old me again because I do want to be with you every day and night for the rest of my life. But most of all, I just pray that you will take me back in your heart because I don't want to cause you or our kids any more hurt or pain ever again. Baby, I love you so much and really miss you a lot. I just hope one day you will forgive me for what I have done.",1
"When we first met, my heart was filled with joy and love. I could not ever imagine life without you. Now, due to my selfish ways, I no longer have you to hold and to love. I miss you, Baby. My heart still beats, but it beats with no purpose, no meaning. It beats with an empty rhythm. Only you can fill my heart again and make it beat with love, with hope, with eternal life. Please, Baby, let's try to put our relationship back together. I need you--my heart needs you.",1
"My eyes couldn't see that you were always there--surrounding me in your love. My heart was closed and I took you for granted. I had to lose you to find you again. For the first time, I truly see you, the lover of my soul. For the first time, I see your smile, the light in your eyes. For the first time, I see myself as I was without you. For the first time, I see myself through your heart's eyes. With you, at last, I know what real love is...for the first time.",1
"Our love started with so much hope, so many dreams. It was a fairy tale that took us both by surprise. It blossomed into a true love that bonded us together. My Darling, my heart and soul belong to you. My destiny belongs in your hands.Our memories are filled with so much joy, and yet so much pain too. In my heart, I know the joy outweighs the pain. I want to embrace the joy and hold it close to my heart where it can live forever. I want to remember the pain as a lesson, a lesson of how much we almost lost. A lesson of life to be lived with a memory of how not to behave. You and I have reopened the door of conversation. I want to know the man you truly are. We can never hide from each other again. This journey I ask you to walk with me will be joyous at times and rough at other times. I don't offer you perfection. I offer you me, a woman who has weaknesses. As long as we can share, and I can show you me (the true me), I feel strong.My love, I don't know how we are going to work thru all of our problems, but I want you to know I am here for the long haul. I want to be with you for the rest of my life. I want yours to be the first face I see when I awake and the last one I seen when I close my eyes at night. I want your hand to be the one I am holding when I die.I have never doubted my love for you, and have never doubted the love you have for me. How do you think I have survived the last four months? I had to leave you for a while because feeling that love and not being able to express it or see it in your eyes was creating such suffering in me. I felt like I was dying inside. Your love has filled me with such warmth, such light, but not to be able to truly feel it coming from you was the darkest, most frustrating hour of my life.I need you. I need to feel you in my arms. You don't know how hard this is to admit to you. For I haven't admitted that I need anyone for so long. Especially not to myself. It really makes me feel vulnerable. Maybe with your help I won't have to feel this way any longer. I do need you, as surely as I need to take my next breath.I need us to hold hands and laugh together, love together, and also to cry together. My life is joined with yours, my love. Not just for the present, but for the past and for the future. Especially for the future. We are separated by so much distance but my love, you live in my heart. You are never far. All I have to do is think of you and you are here.I wish I could offer you promises. I wish I could paint a future with no uncertainties. But I have none to offer. I have no idea what the future holds for us. I just know I want us to experience it together. I think it will be an adventure. Even as I write the word ""adventure "" I know what it means. We have shared so many, and they have never had to be earth-shaking. They are the little ones that have climbed into our hearts and found a home. They are the kind that have created the sweetest memories. They are the kind that only you and I can share and appreciate. That's where my love for you comes from. That and knowing so many new memories await.Sometimes the depth of my feelings for you takes my breath; sometimes just the thought of you makes my breathing more energizing than any I have ever experienced at the same time it calms and soothes me. Sometimes, it's so light, it's not like breathing at all, and that's when I'm sure I'm in love. That's when I'm sure it's true and lasting. It's not just when I think of you, it's when I think of us. But it's really not a thought either, it's an inner presence, it's a sureness.I am trying to be patient for us to be together again, and you know I'm probably the most impatient person in the world. I don't care how long it takes for us to work this out because I am so sure of the outcome. For me the outcome is a life of happiness.My Darling, come dance with me for the rest of our lives.",1
"Eighteen years ago you walked out of my life, and I confess to you that it was the worst thing that ever happened to me. You had such an impact on my being that nothing in my life has measured up to that experience or amounted to anything of such importance.Now, once again, you are back in my life, and it is the most wonderful thing imaginable. My every thought is of you and each time that I am able to talk to you, I am drawn closer and closer to you. I must tell you that I have held you in my heart all these years and nothing has ever made me forget the love that we shared. I do not know what the future holds for us, but I am thankful to God that He has brought you back into my life, and I have a second chance.At any given time when you command it, I will be there for you. Nothing else in this world matters as long as we can live the rest of our days together.I love you, my beloved.",1
"I am writing you this letter to express my love for you. I know we have been through some tough times, but then we never started our marriage off on the right foot. We have been apart now for six months, and it has been the hardest time of my life. I tried to steel myself to keep you from hurting me again and built a wall of defense around my heart. Now you have come back into my life again, and the wall has begun to crumble.There is nothing more in this world that I want other than to start our marriage over again. I know that you are just as scared as I am, and you are afraid to take the steps to do that. I want us to forget about the past that brought us the hurt and pain that we caused each other and that caused us to start all over again. I want you to feel the passion, affection, love, and care that I have to offer you and that I have never been able to show you. We found something special together, and I don't want to give that up. We need to give this marriage the fundamental chance it never had. I know we can do it if we try. I have always said that you are my soul mate and the one I would be with forever.My heart is here waiting for you and ready to put it on the line again to try to make our marriage work. Will you do the same? I am taking this second chance and having faith this marriage will work. I need you to do the same, or we might as well call it quits now. I believe that God will give us the support that we need to make this love last forever if we do our parts. We invited him into our marriage nearly five years ago and asked Him to watch over us and protect us. I believe He will do so again.There is no other way to say it other than, ""I love you, Baby, with all my heart and soul."" I am not ready to give up on us. But I need your help and your love, too, because I cannot do this on my own.It's not necessary for you to respond to this letter. I just wanted to express how I felt inside. I just want you to know how much I love you and I miss you. You will see how happy we can be together, and you won't regret it.",1
"I am so amazed at our relationship. It has been my only dream to be with you again. I am so glad that we have come together to share what we had both been missing for too long. You make me feel as if I am the most important person on earth. It is the most wonderful feeling in the world to feel the love that we cherish. I have loved you since the day I laid eyes on you, and I am excited to be sharing my life with you again. My love for you is beyond any love I have ever seen or ever known. You are my passion for life. Our love is everlasting. It is rare that two lovers so in love reunite after going through so much. I am thankful for your forgiveness and am enjoying every waking moment I spend with you. You mean the world to me; you are my friend. I love you and am so grateful to share what we have both been missing.With all of my love for eternity,",1
"I love you very much. I am deeply in love with you and no one can change my love for you, and no one means no one. You are the true and unconditional love in my heart, and I can't even think of living without you. You are my angel, you are the one ray of hope in my life. I don't think it's possible for me to live without you. Even the thought of living without you makes me uncomfortable.But I don't know what has happened to you. You are not behaving the way you used to. Now whatever I say, you think I am lying. I just want to tell you now that what you're thinking is completely wrong. I am not that kind of a guy. You think that I am after someone else, but this is not true. I know you will say that you will not ever leave me, but I want to see you act like you did before, my sweet babe.And please forgive me for all the hurt that I have caused you. Please, I beg of you to forgive me and come back to me. I love you, and I always will, until the day that I die. Hopefully, when that day comes, I will still have you by my side and you will be the last face that I see. I will be able to hold you in my arms one last time, and tell you how much I love you and how much you really mean to me.Please try to understand my feelings; You are the only one for whom I would ever stop a bullet--yes, even sacrifice my life. Please understand this, and please come back to me as you were before.If you still think that I am lying, if you still do not believe me, then throw this letter out through the window and just give me a call on my cell phone. I promise I won't ask you the details of why you would do this to me. If you think that I am true and my feelings for you are true, then just open your front door. I'll be standing there, waiting for you to give me hugs and kisses the way you did before.",1
"The reason why I miss you so much is because I am in love with you. The nights I am not with you is like when a bird is locked in a cage. You and I were like Barry White and Doldean. My love for you is so real. I want you back, and I have told you that many times. You say you love me and that you want me back too. I want to let you know that I miss you. I am in love with you UNCONDITIONALLY!",1
"As time goes by and we're apart, I think of how things could have been. What we could have said or done to work things through. I would have been more understanding and not so judgmental, more loving and not so hurtful. I would have told you I loved you and cherished you more often. I would have promised you that there can never be, nor will ever be another person who I admire like you, or who has reached the depths of my heart like you have. I would have told you that I'm so very proud of how far you've come and the things you have accomplished.But how could I ever find the words or the actions to explain to you just how much I love you? It would take a million lifetimes to even comprehend my feelings. If such words were easy to express, I would have told you that you took my breath away the very first time I met you. I would have told you that you made be believe in love the first time you kissed me or that you stole my heart the moment you uttered those magical words. I would have told you that every time I looked into your eyes, I saw my destiny. My one and only. My soul mate, my best friend, my lover, my husband, my inspiration, and the father of my children.I can still close my eyes and feel the softness of your lips against mine and your tender fingers as they caress and explore my body. I would have told you that my knees and my entire body would tremble every time you looked deep down into my eyes and explored my very soul. You made me feel like you could read my innermost thoughts. Life just isn't anything without you.I wish that there was a way to make time stop, so we could go back to the time when we where happy. We both know that before we can go back to when we were one, we need to rethink some things about ourselves, in order to make this relationship last. I hope that one day we can find a way to get past this, but until that day comes, I want you to know that I will wait for you a lifetime if necessary, because my love for you is never ending. Don't let our love fade away and our memories scatter to the winds. I'll wait until you come back into my arms (where you belong). I'll love you from now until death and forever onward. There is nothing or no one that will ever change that.",1
"From the first time I saw you, I was attracted to you. Unfortunately we didn't get together until later. But never have I regretted a moment I spent with you! Unfortunately, as I started being distracted with straightening out my future, I forgot about the most important person by my side--you. Things became a mess, but you still stuck by me. Please don't let go now.If I were able to travel back in time, I would go back to the moment I met you and start all over. That time I would have a better understanding of what needs to be done and what makes you happy. We are only human, though and, as humans, we can't do that. The next best thing that can be done is to let me do what I would do if I had that other option now. Let me love you as you should be loved and take care of you for the rest of your life, to see all the places we talked about, and to grow old together, to support you when you love me, or just be there when you just need a shoulder.I am not giving up on you, and I don't ever want to. Fate will never be in our hands, and we can't control the future. Let love be as it is, and let's be happy together while we can.",1
"How are you doing now and today? Hope all is fine. Well, it has been a very long time since we've seen each other and I must let you know that the pain I'm having right now is more than what I can express to you in writing.It's time for us to put away our childish attitude because now I really know how much we are missing each other. Please, do come back to me; you still have a place in my heart, I am assuring you that I have been very lonely ever since you said goodbye.Remember those days when we both shared together the songs we sang together, how we played together, the smiles that come on us each time we see each other. Don't throw away all the sweet memories, which we have shared.My one and only, please come back to me. You still have a place in my heart. I know quite sure that you may feel I will not give you a chance based on the old stories. This is the only opportunity we have to rewrite our history. Never mind, just put away your pride because I'll accept any simplicity at any giving time.Come back, please come back and rewrite our history.It's me, your one and lonely,",1
"I feel in my heart and in my soul each little thing you say to me. I believe you always know when I am sad, when I am happy, or when I think of you more than I usually do. Your words show me how much you understand me, how much you love me, and how much we are connected to each other. Even with the distance between us, I realize more and more that we were meant for each other.When I met you for the first time, I thought I'd quickly forget you, but I was wrong. I still have your face painted on my heart and soul, and in my memory. Although a lot of time has passed since the first time I kissed you, I still have your kiss burning on my lips.Maybe I dream too much, but when I think of you I long to feel your touch, to whisper in your ears words only you would hear if you were mine. There is love so deep inside of me, my love, and in every part of me there is a part of you. You are everywhere that I am. Be certain that I will always be by your side, praying that you will always have a beautiful life.You are already the star of my life, my sky, and my ocean. I will always need you because I cannot live without air, without water, and without my soul, and you are all of this and more for me. I love you now and will always love you. My body still wants to feel you and your hug. I pray that this day will come soon, but if it doesn't, I will still be here for you and only you. All my kisses are yours, my love. I dream of you.From a girl lost in love for you.",1
"I'm not quite sure where to begin. I know this past week has been a mess, and it's been both of our faults. I'm not just directing that at you. I have had ten million things run through my mind the past few days, and I am going to try and get a few of them out right now.For one, I do cherish your friendship. Like I said in one of my messages, you and I have shared conversations about our lives and our families that I would never share with anyone else. The main reason for that is because I trust you, and you listen to me, as I do to you. I can say that I have had some of the most wonderful times with you that I have ever had in my entire life--so much laughing and smiling. I had told you once before that when you speak, I hold onto every word that comes out of your mouth. It's like it's engraved in the back of my mind forever. I don't know why you have that effect on me. Maybe it's the fact that we've become such good friends. To be quite honest with you, I don't trust people very easily anymore, and I could probably say the same for you. I think that is why I did let that wall down and let you into my life and my heart--because I felt safe. So let me ask you, why do you think that I'm building it back up?Let me explain a little what I want in my life. I want someone to share my laughter and my fears. Someone to listen and to be there when I feel like the world is crashing down on me, and I want to give that same courtesy back to them in return. I don't need someone standing at my door waiting for me to get home, or to be around constantly, because that makes me a little jittery. I do think that since you and I have spent so much in-depth time together, I have become a little dependent on you being there and wanting to talk to you. That doesn't necessarily mean seeing you every day, or talking to you in a three-hour phone call, just the reassurance of knowing that you are still there. ""Hi, how are you. How was your day""...just stuff like that. Is that too much for you? It sometimes feels like you only call when you know I am upset. It seems like you hardly ever call just because you want to.You tell me how important it is to you to have me in your life, but as what? Then you say that if I would find someone who makes me happy, you wouldn't want to hold me back from that. Don't you understand how happy I am with you? When you say things like that, it just confuses me. I'm not sure how you differentiate between a relationship and a friendship, but I am going to tell you how I separate the two.For one, I don't spend the weekends with my friends, holding them, talking to them, being intimate, that's just not me. It never has been and never will be. The things that we've shared (and again this is just the way I think--you might disagree), the things that have been between us have been very special to me. They go beyond friendship. Like the night we went to Hetaeras; the way you looked at me, and just the feeling that I get when I am around you. Little do you know whether you want to admit it or not, we have been in a relationship.You yourself have even said that it was the only relationship that has been this special to you, and you've never been so happy. So let yourself be happy, but you have to give a little in return. You have seen the type of person I am, and all that I want to give. I do that for two reasons. For one, it makes you happy; and for two, some people have never gotten a chance to be treated that way, and I think everyone in their life should experience it just once. I wanted you to experience it. Making you happy, seeing you happy...I truly enjoyed that. Well, it's my turn for me to say, I've never been treated like that, and I want to be. I want to feel like I am a special person, that the person I am with enjoys being with me, and in return they clearly show it. Not just meaning physically, but in other ways too. I need to know that someone wants me to be as happy as I want to make them.I feel like you want me around, but you don't want to put out the effort that would be involved with having a relationship. You enjoy what I give you and don't want to lose me, but you don't want to give much in return. A friendly relationship relieves you of the pressures of a romantic or intimate relationship. I think that is why you stress being just friends. That's fine if that is what you want. But you have to understand what friendship is. Friendship still involves giving and taking. You still call friends and you still hang out with friends. But friendship doesn't involve intimacy. I can't have you hugging me and kissing me. You can't expect us to spend the night together. Friends certainly don't have sex.As far as intimacy goes, I am not physically intimate with you because it's a need. I am intimate because I'm just showing you how much I enjoy being with you and having you in my life. When I hug you or kiss you, it's my way of showing you that I do, in fact, care about you, yes, as a friend, but also as a lot more.How do you want us to be? You have to make a decision. We can be friends or we can continue exploring our relationship. But if we are working on the relationship, I expect you to show me your feelings. Show me what I mean to you. Don't just tell me when you are afraid I will leave you. I need to know you want me to stay by your actions. I need to know that you respect my feelings and that you understand them. I need you to give a part of your life to me and not expect that I will do all the work in the relationship.Do you understand now what it takes to have a relationship? It is simple. Give back to me the things I do for you and the way I make you feel. Well, not even that much. But give something in return. Do something special for me. Just think about what you would like me to do for you and do it for me. Think about what would make me smile and do it. Anything worthwhile involves a little work. Is it worth it to you? Is our relationship worth enough for you to put forth some effort to make me happy the way I work to make you happy?If it isn't, I understand. In the beginning, I don't think either one of wanted a real relationship, but it looks like one developed anyway. If it developed because I pushed you into it, then I am sorry. I'll back off.I can't continue seeing you and still feel the way that I feel lately. You give me a mixture of extreme happiness--together with confusion.",1
"You know I love you. It has been almost a year that we've been apart and I still want you back. You must see that. You must realize that I can't give up on us. You were my first and only true love. I made so many mistakes. I shouldn't have been jealous. I see how I had nothing to worry about. I had you and my stupid thinking told me otherwise but my heart always knew you loved me and that you wouldn't leave me, but I had to mess everything up and my pathetic attempts to try and get you back. I tried to forget about you but it is so hard to stop loving a man like you. You're a smart, handsome, good-natured man who has a great future ahead of you, and I want to be a part of it. I believe in second chances no matter how much a person screws up and I screwed up big. I believe we are meant to be together forever and always. We were best friends since the 9th grade and I've loved you since then. Please take me back. Mend my broken heart.",1
"I love you so much, and I miss you. I miss the little things you did like calling me ""Boo Bear"" or ""Baby."" I miss holding you, kissing you; I miss everything about you. You just don't know what you do to me; every time I hold you I feel complete. Every time I kiss you I feel bliss, every time I talk to you, it makes my day. But not knowing if I'll ever hold you, look into your eyes, or kiss you again scares me so much.My heart aches at the thought of not being with you. I cherish the time we spent together--every hug, every kiss, the walks, the talks, just holding hands. I cherish you, I love you, and I'm so glad I found you. I would give anything just for you to be in my arms again; without you I feel so empty. When I'm with you, there is just this feeling that makes my heart beat faster I just feel so good, like I can fly. It's like all the love I feel for you flows through my entire body.When I hold you, I feel so complete. That's why I love holding you. I want to hold you and tell you everything's going to be okay. I want to comfort you. I know you have been hurt before and so have I, so I never want to hurt you. I want to hold you and make the bad feelings go away, yours and mine. I want to hold you and make you feel safe, protected, supported, and loved. When I hold you, it's like nothing else matters except you and me. I want to take you to a place where time stops and there's nothing to worry about except you and me. I want to talk more about you and the troubles you're going through, so I can help you even more. I want to be with you so you can put your mind at ease and not stress about anything anymore.We have all the time in the world to talk or do whatever. I wish I could take you somewhere where we could relax and be free and forget about all our troubles. I want to treat you like a queen, the way you should always be treated. You are my queen. How can I tell you that you mean more to me than life itself? I love you more than life. With each passing day I love you more and more. Just loving you has its rewards. I never want to fight or argue with you; I just want to love you.I just wish you were here right now so I could tell you this. I just keep trying to figure out all the wrongs I've done to you. Maybe I didn't say I loved you enough, maybe I didn't talk enough or open up. Maybe I didn't understand you enough. I just keep coming up with more things that I think I've done wrong to you. If I could, I would go back in time and redo all the wrongs I have done to you and make them right. I just hope you find it in your heart to forgive me for all the things I've done to you and take me back. I should have done a lot of things better that I will do better now.Every time I'm away from you, I feel so empty. I think that's why I pressured you to be with me when you didn't have any free time. All those miles away from when I was in college. I felt so empty inside, wanting to call you and talk, but I couldn't because I had no money for a phone card. I wanted to be with you so much it hurt, and then when I saw other couples on campus holding hands, I felt even worse. You know what I mean. Each minute away from you felt like an eternity. I love you so much.I hurt when you hurt; when you're sad, I feel it. When you're depressed, I'm depressed. I love you so much. I don't like it when you're sad. I want you to be happy like you have made me. I'm so glad I found you. I would do anything to see you smile. I wish I could take away all the troubles in your life. But all I can do is comfort you and be here if you need me. I love you and wish I could do more for you. I want to help you and make you happy.Love is not just saying, 'I love you,"" to that special person; it's so much more than that. It's helping, supporting, being there for them, standing by their side no matter what happens and doing anything you can for them. Love means forgiving and forgetting whatever mistakes they make and accepting them the way they are. I wish I could hold you and comfort you right now. I can only hope the things I do, say, and write bring you happiness like you have given me. You are my heart and soul. If I can do anything more for you, let me know, and I will do it..You mean so much to me and I'm lucky to have you. I try to keep everything you send me; remember when you sent me that email that talked about Valentine's Day? I have a copy of it in my wallet for inspiration or when I feel down I read it. I've had it ever since you sent it to me. I love you so (x a million) much, I cherish the ground you walk on, I cherish everything about you, and I cherish you. You mean everything to me, you are special to me and you make me so happy and I feel so free when I'm around you. You're always on my mind. I think of you everyday, sometimes when I see something on TV or hear a song, I think of you.I love you and think about you all the time and I worry about you. I always wonder how you feel, how you're doing, what you're doing. Because I know you get depressed and sad and I worry about that. I want to try and help you because I've been there and done that. I've been depressed and I know how it feels, that's why I want to help. I love you and I don't want you to have to go through that alone, you may think you have to go at that alone but that's not true. I'm here to help you, I want to support you and I worry about that. I love you so much and I don't want you to worry or be depressed or be stressed out about something. I want to help you and comfort you; I want to try to make you as happy as you make me. You mean the world to me and I love you so much. All I want to do is hold you and love you and make all your troubles go away, I wish I could have told you this earlier.I just want to make you happy, so happy that you would feel as though you could fly. Babe, let's try to piece our relationship back together. I need you--my heart needs you and I feel so empty without you. I love you so much.",1
"If I were given three wishes, I would first wish to wake up in your arms every morning for the rest of my life. I want to breathe the same air that you breathe, when you awake up next to me. My second wish would be that I never harm you, or disappoint you, or break your heart again. I only want to love you like no one has ever loved you before. My third wish is really very simple. I wish that you would only tell me if you wish for any of these same things. If possible, you may still love me and want me with you so to help us get though life together, happy and satisfied. One word from you and I am sure this can be done, because I love you more today then I did before. My love just gets stronger with time; it never fades. I will always love you; this much I'm sure of. I wouldn't ask for diamonds, gold or a million dollars. None of that could make me as happy as I would be to just have you in my life once more!",1
"How I wish I could undo all that has happened. I want nothing more than to love you and to make you happy. I wish there were words to describe how much in love with you I am, but words cannotI have been calling you my Marshmallow Man because you have the softest, sweetest heart I have ever known. I'm not letting you go! I would be the biggest fool ever should I do that. You have spoiled me, made me feel so special with your love. More than that, you have made me whole. Without you, I am incomplete; there is a great void in me. I dare not imagine life without you because the mere thought terrifies me.You are my world, my life, and my love--always. You didn't just steal my heart; you are my heart, my soul, my friend.There have been so many mistakes made, so many wrongs that cannot be undone. Oh, how I wish I had a magic wand and could take away all the pain I have caused you. Let me make it right. Let me show you how much you mean to me. Please, give me another chance.I love you so much. I can't lose you. I won't give up on us. I love you more than I can possibly tell you; let me show you. I promise I will love you like you ought to be loved--forever.",1
"I know I have made a ton of mistakes but I would like to put those behind us, if at all possible, so we can go on with the rest of our lives, keep the good and leave the bad behind us. I know that will be hard, especially after all that I have done, but if we could start all over again from the beginning, I will never hurt you again. I know how much I have hurt you because I made the mistake that I regret to the fullest. I just want to be happy and to feel safe that I'm never going to do that again.I know that it could take forever but if you could please forgive me, that would be my greatest wish. We have both put a lot into this relationship for me to go and screw it up. I just want to make it right again, and for you and me to be back together no matter what it takes.I love you. I will never leave you. I want you. I need you. You are the greatest! I love you, my Sweet, so please, can you forgive me?",1
"Six years have passed since our first encounter, but in those years, we have made many memories and parted ways a few times. But whenever we parted ways, we have been led back to each other as if there is an eternal spark between us--and perhaps there is. Ever since you first entered my life, I felt as if God sent one of his angels down to me, and this is no joke. Over the last few months, I've felt as if my heart has grown stronger because of the love I have for you. This love gets stronger and stronger with each passing day.I long for your soft, warm, and loving touch, not only at sunrise each day, but at each sunset and every night as well. I think and dream about you 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Just hearing your sweet voice at night soothes any blows I've taken during each long day. With a woman like you, I look forward to nightfall and wish that night would come sooner, so we could be together in dreamland.In October, I will show you my true self and all that is in my heart that I can only vaguely describe to you here. You captured my heart fully this year and I'm glad it was you that did it, for it is just the beginning of the journey that we'll take. The words of this letter cannot fully describe what and how I feel about you, but they are the words and the small voice of my heart. You are a one-of-a kind woman. I want you to know that. I cannot wait to finally have you in my strong arms and declare you safe from the world's harm. I cannot wait to feel your soft lips against mine. I cannot wait to feel your heartbeat in union with mine. I cannot wait to look into your bright, beautiful hazel eyes and tell you that I love you. I also cannot wait to run my fingers through your long, flowing blonde hair to ease your worries.Last but not least, I cannot wait to actually wake up in the morning with you lying next to me. As I said earlier, this letter is close to my heart and what I feel for you, and only a sample of what is to come. I have to go now. I want you to know that I promise to love and cherish you for the rest of my natural life. Never forget this letter. You are my one and only. I love you, I loved you the year we met, I love you now, and I will never stop loving you.",1
"I thought this letter-writing thing was going to be easy, but I guess it's not always that way. I have so many feelings to express that I have no idea where to begin. I never expected to feel this way toward you; to be honest, I tried not to fall in love with you. But it got me, it sure got me good. Now that I don't have you, I need you more than ever! I read a quote somewhere once that said, ""It's not missing you now that kills me, it's knowing that I had you in my life once that does."" That is so absolutely true. But what's really bothering me is that I can't tell you how I feel.I made the choice to let you go in the worst possible way. I screwed up so badly, and I don't blame you for never wanting to speak to me or for hating me as much as you probably do right now. You said some pretty nasty things to me, but I don't hold it against you. I could have said a few worse things if I were in your case. I don't really know! I'm broken, remember?I just want to smell your skin one last time, tease you about your cologne, hug you, tug on your ear, make fun of your whiteness, and how you get all your redness from the sun instead of from a suntan bottle, sleep at your house with the cold AC, and wear your cool CK pants to sleep. I will miss all of that so very much!I'm sorry that I was such a jerk and that I never showed you how much I loved you. I remember when you told me more than once to let go and let you love me. I never listened and kept my stupid guard up. I'm sorry! I will always have our shooting stars to remind me of all our happy times. Do you want to know what my last wish was? I wished that I would never be dumb enough to let you go, but I did! I'm so sorry.",1
"Many things have happened in the past, and so many things have changed. It doesn't matter how much time has gone by. Time could never weaken my feelings for you or make them fade away. Now we are back together to give us one more chance. Love, trust, understanding, affection, honesty, tolerance, and loyalty are all key factors for a successful relationship. Every time I think of you, my heart misses a beat. You're my theme for a dream! Every moment we share together, we grow closer. I'm waiting to see you again. I need you to hold me so tight that you fill my world with love.",1
"Hey, Bubby, Don't you think that the time we have spent together is too long to just throw away? Please give me another chance to prove myself to you; I promise that everything will be different between us this time. Please, can we just start fresh--you know, get to know each other again? Please! You are the world to me and I would like to make it up to you if you give me another chance.I love you with all my heart. You are the world to me,",1
"It will always be you that brings fireworks into my life, not just on the 4th of July but every day before and after. I will always love you. Whether we are together or not, my love for you is still as strong as it was in the beginning. Maybe stronger because I am more determined than ever that we belong together. Now if I could only get you to believe it too and to stop being so afraid. I will never hurt you; I will never leave you. I love you unconditionally. I have seen both the best and the worst of you and I love you more because of that. I want to go back to where we were. I want to be even better than that. You know it's right, that's why even though we have been broken up for over a year; we still find our way back to each other every time we see one another. We can't stay away. I see your love for me in your eyes, in your smile and my love for you is reflected back at you every time I look at you.",1
"It has taken me days to write this letter to you. Please read it with care and with the understanding that much thought went into it.I miss the way we were. With all my heart, I wish that there was some way we could go back to the days where your eyes beheld me as the most beautiful woman you had ever seen, when your heart felt lighter in my presence, when the thought of me kept you warm on a cold night. I still think about you this way.I know that I am the one mostly to blame for letting that light in your eyes die. I know that I messed up, that the things that I did were wrong, and I wish that there were something I could do to go back in time and change them. I know what it's like to be hurt the way that I have hurt you. It hurt me to see the pain that I caused you and not be able to do anything to make it better.Now here we are together again, but it doesn't feel the same. I know you still care for me--and even love me--but I wonder if you are ever going to forgive me for the past? How do we get past the hurt and the unhappy memories? Is it even possible? What can I do so that you will forgive me, to let me into your heart once more? Please let me earn back your trust and feel the fullness of your love again!I look back on all that I took for granted, and I only wish that I had appreciated it. I know that if I had it all back again, I would work harder to keep it this time. I wouldn't push it away like I did then. I would enjoy every moment I could bask in the beams of your radiant love. I want a chance to love you the right way this time, but I need you to give me a second chance. The distance between us tears at my heart. Please know, I have suffered for my sins, the greatest suffering I have ever known. I feel as though it is all my fault that I have lost you and your love. I am asking that you forgive me, please!I remember a time when we kissed each other for the shear pleasure of it. How we loved to be next to each other--HAD to be next to each other each waking moment. We couldn't wait until you were home again, and we were holding one another in a tight embrace. I remember the way we would lie curled up together with a pillow for each other, but sharing a blanket with each other. We had all we needed to feel safe, and warm, and happy. You are still everything that I need to make my life complete.As we were going down the road, my head was always on your shoulder as I snuggled up close to you. I smiled contentedly as you sang along with Tim McGraw on the radio. I miss you so much and all those simple, happy times we had together. I remember when we would pull over to the side of the road to look at flowers or to discover the stars on a clear, warm night as we lay in each other's arms. We couldn't resist one another in those days or the need to follow our desire to its climax.We've decided to stay together, I'm glad of that, but what I really want is the chance to do everything right, to make our relationship stronger and better than it ever was. I want the chance to prove that I've changed, that I can be trustworthy, honest, open, giving, and understanding. I know I have a lot to do before I earn back that trust, but I'd like the chance to try. Love is what makes the difficult easy, and the impossible possible. I know I may be asking for the impossible--to be forgiven.I long for the days when my touch affected you; made your heart race and your breathing quickened--when everything within you longed to pull me close. There was a fire in your eyes then, a hunger that I miss. Roses and candlelight may be fine for some, but romance is not what I desire, it is passion that I yearn for, passion that I feel I must have in my life--in your eyes. Time, hurt, and betrayal have erased that passion, but my desire for it is strong. I would do anything to feel desire burning through you as you take me in your arms.I look at you now with new eyes. I have a new appreciation for the wonderful things about you that once I took for granted, and the beauty of a face that reflects both the man I love and my dearest friend. No longer can I take you for granted, you are too important to me, too precious on every level--the man I love; the one whose love I once held in my hands. If only I had treated you right then, I know that I would be holding you still.The words of a song keep floating through my head: ""If ever you're in my arms again, this time I'll love you much better. If ever you're in my arms again, this time I'll hold you forever. This time will never end."" Even though you are in my arms, I know that you don't trust me with your heart yet. If ever I have the chance again, I would do everything so much better. But I'd like to know if that chance will ever come. Will you give me anything more than a reluctant reconciliation? I long for so much more. I need so much more. Maybe I have no right to hope for it, but I do.With regrets of the past and hopes for the future, I love you,",1
"This letter formally requests that I be reconsidered for location in the ""Space Vacant"" area of your heart. Until now, you had leased this property to a former occupant, who I had requested you issue with a foreclosure notice--but all in vain, resulting, instead, in my removal from the love ring, duly demolishing me in your heart and in your mind, leaving me ultimately without a home. Now, however, that the aforementioned occupant has vacated the premises, I have decided to submit a new application for reconsideration. I hope you will review the facts and accept me as the new tenant and take down the current ""Place Vacant Till..."" sign.Thank you for your review and reconsideration.",1
"I believe in my heart and soul that we were meant to be with one another. I think about you every day and night. When I am with you, you light up my life. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me, and every night I wish upon a star for you to return to me again. The love that I hold for you in my soul is greater than an ocean or wider than the sky above. Please forgive me for all the hurt that I have caused you. Please let me return our love to you the way it was meant to be. I love you, and I will until the day I die. Hopefully, when that day comes, I will still have you by my side and your angel face will be the last one that I see. I will be able to hold you in my arms one last time, and tell you how much I love you and how much you really mean to me. I love you!!",1
"It feels like I have spent my entire life trying to find someone like you. You were my first love, my only true love. You are the one person I've loved more than anyone in the world. There is no reason to fool myself anymore. I loved you from the first moment I laid eyes on you, and I have ever since.As I look back on our past together, I often wonder how you were ever so patient with me. Until this moment, I have never realized just how lucky I've been to have you in my life. If I had been you, I would have walked away from me a long time ago. Yet your love was so unconditional and pure, like the beautiful person you are. You always accepted me for who I am, willing to sacrifice everything for me. I don't deserve an angel like you.It brings tears to my eyes to realize how many times I might have lost you, how much I took your love for granted, and how many times I was foolish enough to think that I could fix my life on my own. Please forgive me for all my foolishness.I have finally opened my eyes and realized that I love you more than words can say. I don't know how many lifetimes it will take to make up for lost time or to repay the kindness and endless love you've shown me, but I want you to know that I am going to try.All I ask is please be patient and understanding, as these times are difficult and a struggle for both of us. I am torn between survival and my feelings for you. Life throws us many curves. The path may be long and hard but, in the end, the road widens and life changes for the better.You don't have to say anything or do anything. I just wanted you to know that no matter what happens in this life, you will always be the special love in my heart. It's true. As they say, it is better to have loved and lost, than to never have loved at all. I am happy that I knew true love, for it is from that love I have gained my most cherished memories.From now to eternity, you'll be in my heart every moment of every day. Thinking of you makes me happy and, for as long as I live, I will never stop dreaming of the reunion of our two hearts.Thank you for sharing your love and your life with me. Thank you for showing me true love.",1
"Tonight I write about my love for you. I know that in the course of our five years together, we have been back and forth, and in an out, but yet, through it all, we still hold on--holding onto a dream that one day we will be happy together again, the way we were before.I know people often dream about a love like ours; that's why I try to hold on to it. To ease my mind I need to know why do you still hold on? I cannot change the past, only work towards the future. I see in my future you and only you. You are my sunrise and sunset--my whole being of myself, living only for you. You make my rainy days seem happy and my sunny days something to look forward to as I wake each day. I know I'm not perfect and maybe I'm a little rough around the edges, but I know that I can be all you want, desire, and need in a woman.We created a lovely baby, made completely out of love. Every day I look at her, she reminds me of the love we once held so dear. The day you packed your things and left, a part of my heart broke through the endless tears and not knowing what is to become of us. It really has me afraid that this time, the end may truly be the end.I am thankful we keep trying, for you are the most important person in my life, and nothing will ever change that, my soul mate. I love you so deeply that even words cannot express them clearly enough.",1
"It's fair to say that the past few weeks have been somber and gloomy for me. It has been like living in the dark, as though a big black cloud has engulfed me.I have also felt like there has been a piece missing from my heart and, although I wasn't sure what that piece was, I now realize it was the part I gave to you. You are my missing piece.Now, slowly, it's as though that piece is being fumbled back into place and I'm starting to see a glimmer of light, just as though someone, somewhere has turned on a light and it's starting to flicker alive.It's hard for me to explain what the feeling is. All I can say is that when I've been with you, lately, the movie I'm watching seems better, the music I'm listening to sounds more alive, even things like doing the dishes are more fun when you're in the room.Everything I've ever done in my life has been better, brighter, and more exciting when I've been able to share it with you.I want you to know that the most important thing in my life is you. Nothing beats holding you in my arms, touching your hair, and smelling the scent that belongs to you alone.I would never want you not to know the way I feel about you. I love you. I'm sure you must realize that, but for me, that is no longer enough. I want you to really know how much I love you.But I so dearly need the comfort and the security of knowing that whenever I say, ""I love you,"" you're going to say the same words, too. But I just wish that sometimes you would say them before I do--and make me believe you don't have to be prompted.I've always felt so lucky that you decided to share your life with me, and there's nothing, just nothing, I wouldn't do to make you happy. I just want you to want me. Just like I want you.There's no price you can put on love. I know you just can't make love come back to the way it was. I know it'll come back, if and when it's ready. I just want you to know that for every ounce of love you give to me, I will give it back to you a thousand times more.I worship you and adore you and no one could ever compete with the beauty I see when you stand before me. I would never do anything to hurt you, I want only to love you and re-build our life together. I don't need anyone else but you.If only I could have come up with the right words to describe the depth of the feelings that I have for you, I would have uttered them to you a thousand times.You're all I've ever dreamt of, and you are the best thing that ever happened to me.I love you more than my life, more than my world. You are my world. Life wouldn't be life if I couldn't share it with you.",1
"Through the turmoil of almost 10 years of our life together, our love has persisted and overcome all obstacles. Both of us have weathered crises that have struck us together and apart. Until now, that is, when the true test of love and partnership will have to be made.I still gaze into your eyes and touch your soul without a word as you do to me. I still thrill to your touch and the tender caress that is now infrequent. All the confusion is cleared away when our hearts open wide to receive the warmth of each other's love and our tenderness toward each other arouses our physical feelings. Although our spirits are now divided, yet they merge in the cosmos, and both of us still feel what the union of the lion with the scorpion can be, the intensity and fulfillment of life's dreams.The time is now; the choice to love is ours. Look deep within your heart to find the answer. I have long waited to feel your embrace again. Please let the stars shine upon us once again.",1
"I've loved you so much all these years, and those feelings can't and won't ever leave this heart of mine. Every time I am with you, I want to let you know that I miss you so much. You are that someone, that special person that I could never deny my love for. I have made some really messed up choices and went down the wrong roads in our past and in our relationship, but I need you to know that because of all of those choices, I have made a turn for the better. I need you in my life, my arms, my heart, and in my world.Can you stop and think about the question I am about to ask you very hard? I am asking for the opportunity to love you with all that I am now and all that I will be in the future. I don't want to continue living my life feeling empty and lonely any more. Just the mention of your name is an instant smile, goose bumps, and a wish of us being together again. I still need you and I still would like to call you ""Sexy"" as well as you to call me your fantasy again.",1
"I have been trying to reach you with no luck. I am posting this so, hopefully, one day you will find it. I don't know if that's possible, but maybe I will get lucky, and someone we know will see it and tell you about it.The Air Force has really changed the man I once knew, but it was for the good. You have done so much for yourself, I couldn't be more proud of you.I know that things between us went terribly wrong. I want to fix them. I am not pointing fingers or placing blame on anyone. I just want to fix them. The last night we spent together was something I have needed for so long. I wish it would have never ended. I thought seeing you again would make me nervous, but it felt as good as it always has. It felt like coming home again. It felt natural and calming.I miss you so much. I know that you are going to Iraq soon, and I am dreading it. I am scared I will never see your sweet face again. I will be praying for your safe return. I feel as if you are so far away, even though Charleston is pretty much right down the road. I want to see you again before you go overseas, so I am praying that you will come here to see me again.I know we are no longer a couple, but I wish we were. I have always been there for you and nothing will ever change that. I still love you more than anything in this world. I still want to be an ""officer's wife"" as you so eloquently put it that day. I hope that someday, this will find you. Until then, I will keep trying and hoping for the best.",1
"There are many things in life that people wish for: cars, big houses, great jobs, yachts. All I want in my life is you and your love. We have been through storms and reached the sunlight over and over again, and right now we are back into darkness. Through the many years we've spent with each other, my love for you has continued to grow and grow. Right now, I want you to know that my love for you will never die. Let's step back into the sunshine. We have the means. I love you.",1
"It's been so long since I've been in your arms, felt your touch, or looked into your eyes. The worst part about it all is that I only have myself to blame for it all. I'd give anything for just one last chance to be with you. I thought I was over you, but who am I kidding, I'm not. Please tell me what it would take to be close to you again, I'd do whatever you ask me to. I miss you.",1
"I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but that doesn't mean that I don't think about you each and every day. You don't know just how much I wish that I could be lying there with you, whispering in your ear my heart's deepest desires.I close my eyes and let my thoughts of you flow. I carry on a conversation in my mind between us, as we tell each other our hopes our dreams--if only we could do that. I picture us lying in bed, your arms around me, my head upon your chest, my fingers gently circling over your skin. My soft lips place a whisper-soft kiss on your neck. I can hear the beating of your heart getting louder and faster. In my mind, your lips capture me and hold me there in ecstasy. We look in each other's eyes, lost--no, found. I feel your hands caress me as you whisper against my ear. You make sweet, sweet love to me and wipe away any tears. A slight laugh, mixed with a cry, such beautiful feelings make me sigh. Each time you touch me feels like the first time.As each night passes, your presence seems more real here with me, but then I open my eyes and realize it was all just another dream. Tears fall from my eyes. Pain sears through my chest. My heart is crying out for you.I have tried so hard to fight these feelings I have, but I can't do it anymore. I know that I love you, but I didn't want to tell you because you are leaving the country for three years, and I didn't want my heart to hurt, but I can't stop feeling this way. I am so in love with you, and this feeling grows deeper and deeper each day.We only knew each other for a couple of weeks, and you already had me completely and totally to yourself. I don't even want to think about being with anyone else. I thought that if I stopped talking to you, I would forget how I felt. I thought that if I could keep myself busy, I would be okay, but I can't forget and I'm not okay. I am so overwhelmed by my feelings for you; I am hungry to hear your voice again and to feel your touch. I can't let you go to Japan without seeing you at least one more time.Last week, I put those pictures of you on my desk at work. People walked by and asked me if you are my husband or my boyfriend. I tell them, ""Neither. He is just the man who has my whole heart."" That is the best and only way that I can describe you.I feel terrible that I didn't talk to you these last two months. So many nights I cried my eyes out, missing you so much, but too afraid to pick up the phone because it had been so long. What would I say? What would you say? I am afraid that you would tell me that you don't want to talk to me anymore. I don't think I could handle that right now.I know that you told me that you aren't looking to rush into anything, but this has been eating away at my heart for awhile now, and I couldn't hold it in any more. This doesn't mean that I want to run off and get married or anything crazy like that. It just means that I love you, completely and totally. I am here for you whenever you need me.I'm going to try to call you tomorrow. Hopefully you can forgive me for the pain that I have caused you. I promise I will not disappear again. I love you.",1
"You have been the best boyfriend in the world. Any girl would be happy to be in my shoes. You have taught me so much, even if you think you know little. You said when I came into your life, I changed you, but no one can change anyone--you're the only one with the power to change yourself.Thank you for all the material things--from Winnie the Pooh dolls to designer handbags. You shower me with gifts and get me anything I want in the world, but even though you have money now, it didn't buy my love. Love must come naturally, and it did. You bought me everything I ever wanted and more. The only thing left is an Escalade XLT, but hey, I guess that can wait, huh? Just joking!No matter what your decision is, please keep me in your thoughts and remember that I love you. Material things are nice, but love is best. You always told me that I was the finest girl you had ever seen, so get off work early, and let's kick back together for once. I love you.",1
"You once gave me your trust and honesty; I did what I wanted with it, including hurting you in many ways. You gave me your love and I stomped on it. Many years have past and I found my true self. And again you trusted me. Now is time for me to give you my trust and honesty.I see you in different eyes--I see you like never before. I see a father and a husband-to-be. Will you be my husband forever and ever? I give you my heart and soul. I love you more each day I'm by your side and I thank you for giving me another chance to give you my love and to appreciate you the way I should have many years ago.",1
"My love for you grows greater every day. I fall in love over and over again. My only thoughts are of what I can do to make you happy, to allay your fears and restore your faith in me and your love for me. The more I love you though the more I fear losing you. I have no idea the thoughts, feelings and memories that haunt you and keep you from loving me the way that I want and need you to. I only know that what ever it is that effects you so deeply must be real and profound and that only you can work through what is confusing you so. But know that I am here for you a new and changed man ready to give you everything I have in my heart and soul to help you.What and who I always thought you were is not what or who you have become or are becoming. I only hope and pray that the journey you are on of self discovery includes me when you reach the end of that journey. The last eight weeks have been a time of self discovery for me too. I have looked inside myself to see who I am, what I want and what kind of future that I want ... I am my wife's husband, a man who adores and worships her, a man who loves her unconditionally, who respects her and only wants the best from himself for her and only wants the best that life has to offer for her. I am a man who thinks his wife is the most beautiful, sexy and desirable women and a man who wants no other women other than his wife. I am the father of her children, a man who conceived his children with love with their mother and wants to raise them with the love and by the side of their mother. I am a father who wants to teach his sons what he has learned about respect, love, honor and above all else appreciation of and for a women that they will love. I am a father whose wife and children are the most important things in his life and will never do anything to jeopardize that. What this man wants is a family that enjoys doing things together, finds joy with each other and learns from each other. I am a man who wants a wife who feels the same way and looks at me adoringly and who I can arouse the same passion for me in her as she does for me. I am a man who wants to work hand in hand and heart to heart with his wife to have a future where each day is better than the day before. I am a man who wants to know his wife's interests, fears, passions, wants needs and desires so I may help her realize them or support her in her pursuit of them.That is who I am and what I want--no money, no big house, no cool job, just those things. These are what truly matter to me now.I know you have been disappointed by so many, taken advantage of by people you trusted. I know you have been belittled and minimized. I know you have been what others have wanted you to be and that you lost yourself even before you even knew who you were. I am so sorry that those things happened to you and I regret and accept my part in some of those things. But I will spend the rest of my life making up to you for that transgression.Baby, so much of what happens in life is pure chance, had I not gone into Chili's that night there would be no sweet natured, polite boy Tyler, there would be no stubborn strong willed, aggressive little boy Logan and Jonathan may or may not have had the benefit of a father. Your life and mine would be drastically different--maybe better, maybe worse. Think back to all the major things in your life, the drastic changes good and bad. If you follow them back to the source they were mostly pure chance that takes us down those paths. From the people we meet, the jobs that we take to the traffic light that holds us an extra five minutes and changes our day completely ... all chance, all luck.But the decision that you will make regarding us is free will--not chance, not luck but a thought out decision that will have profound effects and changes on so many lives. We, going our separate ways, might work out for the better but it is still an unknown thought. I can't say what is best for you. I can only say what is best for the boys, you and me as a couple and all of us as a family. If we weather this together there is nothing that can ever break us apart. We will be so far down the road, more mature, more secure and more in love than ever before.I want you to know that the Ron you fell in love with is still here inside of me but there is more, there is a mature man here now--a man who truly understands what love means, a man who now understands what honoring a woman he loves requires. A man who will spend his life showing and proving his love every day and a man who will put your happiness above his own because he loves you so much.Your disappointment and fears that you feel resonate in me, I feel them and I hurt for you: for the hurt, uncertainty and fear that you are living with. It also scares me to think that the love I feel and the effort I am applying to prove my love and desire for you may not be enough to sooth and calm your hurt, fears and disappointments. If you let yourself, I believe you can find a life that satisfies you right here. I believe if you let go and let me in to your heart, that your desires and passions for me can be rekindled. I know that I love you enough to let you grow and blossom into the person you want to find and become. I believe that we can be closer than ever, learn more about each other and become one with each other. In other words I believe in us.You only know the pain, hurt and neglect of this relationship. Your basis for comparison to what you imagine could be is skewed by the bad memories of the past. If you let me in, let me prove to you that my change and feelings are profound and real I believe we can make it through. The ember of love that is glowing that is keeping this relationship together can be fanned to roaring flame of passion and love.For better for worse, in sickness and in health till death do us part, I believe in that, I am committed to that. I will honor it gladly, happily with love and passion. You are what I want--what I need. In my eyes the sun rises and sets with you, you color my world and bring joy to me. You can be what you need to be. Become who you are seeking to become or are destined to become. You are so much more than I ever gave you credit for. You are truly an exceptional and gifted woman who is capable of doing anything and I will never ever think anything less of you. I will always believe, respect and support you in anything you do. I will respect all your talent and skills, I will never disrespect you or think you not capable of anything because you have proved that you are an individual; whole person. A person with thoughts, feelings and opinions that have value and deserve honor and respect. You are a person that I will proud to call my wife, my lover and my friend. What I did not give in the past will flow freely from my heart to you now.You are my world, I am lost without you, I am a rudderless ship floating on stormy seas without you in my life. I love you so, so very much. My desire and lust for you burns hotter than the fire of the sun. When I look at you I see so much beauty, natural beauty and sensuality. For me, that will never change--I promise. If you let me and teach me, I will be the lover that you deserve. I receive so much pleasure and satisfaction when I see you smile or when you're happy and I know I had something to do with that happiness. I will spend the rest of my life as the happiest man on earth--simply by making you happy. I love you always and forever.",1
"I wish I could go back in time to our relationship, back before hurt found its way into our hearts. If only I could slip back into those moments, I would have been more honest with myself and more attentive to what my heart was telling me. I would have held you a little longer and never, ever hurt you, but time will not allow me to go back and change any of my mistakes.I can't take away the questions that flood you, but I can try to answer them. I can't erase the pain that fills your heart, but I can try to ease it. I know that I can't just jump back into your life and expect everything to remain the same, nor can I expect you to still have the same feelings for me. A lot of time has passed, and just because I feel as though I am ready to have you in my life again, it may now be different for you. I know I can't have things fall into place whenever I am ready for them; destiny has no patience and holds back for no one. I might have lost my chances with you because of my ignorance and my fear of falling in love, but I can't ignore this gut feeling in my heart like I once did before.I want us to work things out, and though it might not be possible, if you're willing, I want to try. I am no longer frightened as I was before, and when I was with you, I should have realized from the beginning that I never had any reason to worry about anything.I miss you. If for whatever reason, things don't work out between us, or if you choose to remain just a friend, that's perfectly fine. I will take it as fate passed me by and that we just weren't meant to be together. Whatever the outcome might be, please know that I am still so grateful to once have had you a part of my life.",1
"Without you I am lost. I close my eyes and all I see is your disappointed face looking down at me. I find myself laying there for hours, unable to sleep. I wonder if the day will ever come when you will forgive me and be here to hold me. Whenever I get a chance to steal just a moment with you, I feel so alive again. You make me think I can hold on to another day of hope, with dreams of us being together one day soon. It will not come soon enough for me, but I will hold onto those dreams with all my heart because I believe at the end of every storm there will be a rainbow. Please wait for this storm to pass so we can have our rainbow for the rest of our lives.My heart belongs to you always.",1
"I just want to let you know that you are in my heart and in soul. I never want to lose the love we have. You are my life and I never meant to hurt you the way I did. I wish I could go back in time and change what I did, but I can't. The only thing I can do is make things better for us--and make you happier than ever. I wish you only knew how much I love you. I don't know what I would do if I had never met you. You have brought me so much happiness. I don't want that to ever disappear.I know that you love me and that you do want to trust me again. I am trying everything I can to show you that you can trust me again. I don't want to ever lose you. I want us to raise our child who is soon to be born--together. I don't want to do it alone.I really miss you and I need you back. My heart is not whole now that you are not here. Please come home so we can start all over and make everything better than it was. I swear that I will never hurt you again. I promise. I don't want to lose you for anything. Baby, I am waiting for you, please come back soon. I love you with all my heart and soul.",1
"I want the world to know that there is no one out there more precious than you. You really have completed my life by giving me a second chance. Now I don't have to ever wonder if you are getting mistreated by nasty girlfriends because I'm now comforted to know that I am the only one who will take care of your every need from here on out.My life has changed drastically with your presence. I long to have children of our own, and I know that you will be a wonderful father. I love you more than I ever have before. Your love is heaven for me. I need nothing else in the world as long as I have your love. You have shown in so many ways how you feel towards me. I am honored to be spending Valentine's Day with you, especially since we have missed the last eight years together. Thank you for giving me a piece of heaven. My dream has come true and I thank you for all these wonderful gifts. You are the best, and I will continue to give you all my love.",1
"I have been thinking a lot lately about what went wrong and what makes me feel so awful. I was just so head-over-heels falling in love with you that I did some foolish things, but I just couldn't help trying anything to win back your attention.Sometimes I feel you don't give me all your attention when we speak. I know you have been busy and have a lot of pressure at work. I'm just not used to it. I mean, you seem quite cold. Whenever we chat, I just want to have your attention. I also realize that I need to pay more attention to your needs. I am sorry for what happened and I really want you back. I want things to be as they were.I know that I've hurt you, so I'm asking for your forgiveness and hope that we can start over again. I really cherish those moments when everything was going great. I can hardly take the reality of losing you. I need you in my life again. I'll call soon.",1
"Sorry for the late response.I pondered what went wrong the last time we chatted. I wasn't really expecting a sudden burst of emotion from you. Perhaps I responded too harshly.I perfectly understand the way you feel. You are a very interesting woman with a kind heart, and from the day we met I felt affection towards you. That feeling grew even stronger until I found myself longing for you. I thought it was only a fling between two lonely people who needed special affection, caring, and attention; however, it's become more as the days have gone by. I fell in love with you. Your kindness, warmth, sweetness, respect, and trust in me was there until last Friday when you shut me completely out! Now I feel sorry for myself for the way I acted.I am so sorry if I hurt your feelings and gave the impression I don't respect you. I do respect you. I want to try to win back your affection.Let's start again and have more happy memories.",1
"I know that I'm not perfect, but I know that I don't want to give you up. I have waited too long to hold you in my arms. I know that we belong together. I love you a lot, and I know that you know that. I guess I just need to vent and let you know how I feel. Please don't take my venting the wrong way. I do love you and don't want to break up with you. That would just make me even more imperfect than I already am.",1
"Since the day we met, I've grown deeply in love with you. My love for you becomes so overwhelming that I can't handle it when I don't see or talk to you! You make me feel wonderful. You give me strength when I can't carry on. You make me smile and laugh a lot, and I truly treasure that.I apologize straight from my heart for ignoring you and being rude to you, even when you make an attempt to make me feel better. You are a very patient man, and I thank you for that. I don't ever want to take advantage of your patience, not ever. I know I over-react a lot, and I'm sorry for my part in the quarrels.You are the most wonderful thing that has EVER happened to me. Until now, I never thought I would find a love that is as strong as yours. But now that we've found each other, I've changed my mind. You are the person I want to marry. Together we can raise children, and we can spend the rest of our lives together. Baby, you complete me. You make my life so brilliant that I don't know how else to repay you but to love, care, and support you more and more as time goes by. You're the one and only star in my sky. You make me feel very beautiful. Thank you for giving me so much.I can't imagine what it would be like if we were to lose each other. I don't even want to think of it, Baby. All I want to think of is you. You are the love of my life. May God bless your beautiful soul. From the bottom of my heart, I love you and I am sorry for upsetting you.",1
"I hope you find it in your heart to forgive me and let yourself believe in me and in my love for you. I know I don't make things easy for you. Sometimes my overwhelming feelings for you frighten me and I run, but my heart always brings me back because I love you. Forgive me and I will never leave your side again.",1
"I'm sorry for what I did to you. I'm really ashamed of what I've done. The truth is that I love you. I can never think clearly or make a decision without you. I am nothing without you. Together we had a started a new life.At times I do get selfish and rude, but I don't mean to be that way. I always want to see you happy. Sometimes I do silly things to make you laugh and feel happy so that you would know that I care for you.Ups and downs are a part of life. You shared each and every part of your life with me as I did with you, so why do we quarrel? It frightens me. Why do we hurt each other's feelings? We promised not to let any tears come into each other's eyes. You are a part of my soul, a part of me, and I feel that I am a part of you.I love you and want to be with you.",1
"I sit here in sorrow, wishing I could hold you. I've realized that there is no one to replace you since I made the foolish decision to leave you. No one can make me laugh and smile like you do. You are the only one that ever made me so happy. No one could ever take your place. I feel as if my soul has stolen my heart and left me to cry myself to sleep each and every night with guilt in my heart for how I have hurt you. I guess I did not realize I had until I lost it. I was so stupid to leave you. I know ""sorry"" is just a word but I am very sorry. I beg with every ounce of my soul for you to forgive me. Please reconsider and take me back.",1
I have missed you these past few days! I didn't mean to hurt you. You know I hate seeing you angry. I do not want to do anything to annoy you. A day without you in my life is like a day without sunshine. You are my sunshine. Your absence in my life means I am in darkness. I need you for many reasons.Please try and find it in your heart to forgive and forget.,1
"There are no words to express the importance you have in my life. It seems like everything that was bright has faded away without you, and there is no color in the world for me anymore. My love, I know we have been through very hard times together, but I accept that it was all was my fault. I also sincerely apologize to you, and I want you to know that I love you so much and can't live without you. Baby, please accept my apology and come back to me.I love you very, very much.",1
"I tried to look past what was bothering you. I know we met through my ex, who was also your friend, and you tried to warn me about him. Since then you became my best friend. Whenever I needed someone to talk to, no matter where you were or what you were doing, you comforted me. I took advantage of your kindness, and I'm sorry.When we sat down and had that talk, you told me that since I had a relationship with your friend, you and I could never be, and that you looked at our relationship only as a friendship. I did not want to hear that because I had already fallen in love with you and could not tell you. I told you never to call me again. I am sorry that I did not understand or didn't even try to understand the way you felt. Now that I've pushed you away, I really miss talking and laughing with you, but I am too embarrassed to just call and talk to you now. I can never forgive myself for being this way. I am so sorry I've let you, my best friend, go. I hope someday you can forgive me.",1
"After our conversation today, I was upset that I didn't express to you how I feel. I want you to know that I never meant to hurt you. I know that I hurt you when I talked about that subject last night. I never meant for you to feel so hurt. I thought of you many times during the night, wishing you were by my side.I tell everyone about you and how excited I am to see you again. You mean the world to me. I am always lonely between the times we see each other. I always find myself trying to keep busy, because if I sit still for too long, my heart begins to ache, and I feel your absence. At night, I make believe that you are beside me, caressing me, holding me, loving me. I've longed for that day for so long. I adore you.I know that our love can last. My love for you is not only of this world. It goes beyond all human knowledge. It is immortal.Darling, I love you with all my heart and all my soul, and I have no regrets over falling in love with you. I am elated to have fallen in love with such an intelligent, wonderful, and loving angel, who loves me with all my imperfections. Let's talk.",1
"I am so proud of the person you've become. You inspire me. I understand you've been through a lot and neither one of us have always made the best choices, but I believe we both have grown. I've always known from the very first time I met you that you were a stronger person than I.You are so full of wisdom about life that when you talk, I could just listen forever. Your open mind is wise and comforting. You have helped me see things in a brighter, happier, more enlightened way. I was drowning from my own fears and was completely cynical about love, hope, and security. I used to think that no one understood me or could ever truly love me.When I got to know, I realized I wasn't alone. I knew that something inside of you was hurting too. I went through a time in my life when I felt worthless and unloved, and I continuously searched for happiness. This year you became my survival. I don't think I could have made it without you.I thank you for all the fun times we spent together even if they were short-lived. I have come to the conclusion you are an angel sent by God to help me see the light. Clouds of darkness shadowed over me, but you make me smile with just your presence. You are my angel, and I thank you once again from the bottom of my heart. Please know you will always live in my heart and I will continue to hope that we can be together soon.",1
"Baby, I'm sorry for being so insensitive, less caring, and a less loving person. I'm sorry if I don't understand the reasons for everything that you do. I know that I've been so unfair these past few days, but that doesn't mean that I don't love you anymore. I'm like this because I'm so scared of being alone. I'm scared that your love for me will vanish like a sudden wind.I'm trying to be strong and to be positive. I hope that you can forgive me and accept me as I am. I love you always and forever, and I'm really sorry.",1
"Many people don't like to speak up when something bothers them, thinking that it is trivial to mention it. Unfortunately, after repeated times of not speaking up, some small incident occurs, which becomes the proverbial straw that breaks the camel's back and an argument develops.I feel like this is the story of our relationship. I hate arguing with you. I hate hearing that pain-filled tone in your voice, or feeling your cold shoulder. I'm not naturally an angry person; you've known that since you first met me.Our recent argument was caused by so many things: my insecurities, my lack of self-worth, my selfish desire to be the only one that makes you smile. I know that the blame is mostly mine.I'm sorry for not taking the time to be patient with you, to sit and listen and understand the way you feel. I know that you want to keep the good relationships with your friends and family and should not resent them.If you could ever forgive me, I will make up for it.",1
"You were and still are the great love of my life. I know that phrase is often used but it fits this situation. I made so many mistakes when we were together and, as a result of them, we're not together anymore. I've spent the time since then kicking myself for the things that I did, and for the things that I didn't do. All I can do now is say I love you, I love you, I love you.A million times I'm sorry and a million times I love you. Sorry that I couldn't say those words to you when it would have made a difference. Sorry that I didn't give you the innermost parts of me that you expected. I want you to be happy with me. Please forgive me.",1
"Babe, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you; you are my life, my heart, my soul and so much more. I want to say that I really do love you. Also, please, please, Sweetheart, give me another opportunity to show you that I can love you right.I swear I won't do anything that will hurt you again. I want you to know that I never have cheated on you. You are everything to me. Give me a chance to show you that my love for you is real. I will love you forever.",1
"That Sunday night was one of the worst nights we've ever had. Now I just want you to know that, no matter what happens, I will never stop loving you. I said some stuff that I really regret, but I usually try my best to do right by you, and I will continue to do so if you give me another chance.Last Saturday, we had a great night together, and now we are fighting. Now our relationship is hanging by a piece of thread. I just can't let you slip away from me. I love you, and I hope you can forgive me, even with all my faults. You are everything and that is why I asked you to marry me. I want to spend the rest of my life with you so let's make this work, okay, Baby? I love you!",1
"I know this will be the biggest secret that I will reveal this year. In the past I looked on you as a close friend. I know there are times when I've really insulted you, as if you're not a friend, but all this time I did not tell you that you are the most important person in my life.There are times when I am really down, and all I want to do is be you. There are times when I tell myself that everything would be okay because I have you. I am beginning to realize that you are so distant that I can never reach you. Maybe, it's my entire fault for wanting you my way.Sorry, if sometimes I seem not to care. Sorry, if sometimes I do not appreciate you.I want you to know that during all this time we have been with each other, I've really loved you. I have loved you more than you'll ever know. So tell me now, please, that it's not too late?",1
"I know I have been very stupid. I know I am not perfect. I also know that I love you. I know I made a mistake. You once told me that we can face any challenge together. All we need is to love each other and we will come out all right. Our dreams will come true.Let's please give it another try. This time I am begging for your forgiveness. I promise I will make the sun shine for us again. If know there will be more rainy days, and we will fight, cry, and be sad, but behind each cloud there will be a silver lining. So please take me back into your life.Let's find the rainbow together.",1
"Things are hard right now, and everything seems to be just a big, painful mess. But I don't blame you alone for any of it. I know this is my fault, too, so I don't expect you to say or do anything to fix it by yourself. I know we are trying to make a lot of screwed up things in our lives better right now, and I hope we eventually can.All I know right now is that I'm only truly happy when I'm with you. Your mere presence lights up my world. Everything I am and everything I have depends on you and your involvement.I am sorry for the way I have mistreated you in the past. It is okay. I know you have your regrets too. I know we can be happy again if we want to work everything out, which I think we can do.You are everything to me, and I love you with all my heart. I hope I can learn to open up to you more, and let you know how I feel. I believe you will be able to recognize when something is wrong, too. But no matter what we do or what happens, I will always love you, Baby, just like in our favorite song. You mean the world to me. Please, let's get back to the way we were.",1
"This letter is long overdue. So many arguments happened these past few weeks.I just wanted to tell you that no matter what has happened, I still love you with my entire heart, and I know that these misunderstandings don't mean anything more than just hasty words.You may think I don't love you anymore. However, from this day on, I'm going to try harder to become a better person and not to be so stubborn about everything.I know that you are the most important person in my life and that if I continue in this way, I may just lose the love we share.I am determined to become a better person.Hugs and Kisses!",1
"I've known you for three long years and, through those three years, I have learned so much about you. I've found out so many things that hurt me and pleased me. But regardless of past occurrences, I'm glad I'm with you now.I've watched you grow from a freshman to a responsible young man and for that I'm grateful.Hopefully we will live our lives together as planned. I don't want to spend it with anyone else but you, Baby. So, on this note, I'm letting the whole world know that I'm deeply in love with my high school sweetheart.",1
"I'm sorry I've been so moody lately. I have not been feeling well and have had a lot on my mind.I know it has been difficult to be around me when I am moody. I do love you with all my heart. Please tell me we'll never grow apart. Forgive me, please.",1
"I just wanted to tell you how much you mean to me. I've loved you since we first met. You are my prince and my angel. Though I don't always say this to you, I want you to know that I love you very much. I can't afford to let you go because you're the reason I've changed so much for the better! I love you and I need you.",1
"Please forgive me for my actions these past few months. I have not been doing my job as a mother, as your wife, and as your lover. You deserve more. I love you so much! From this point forward, I will show my love for you and do my duties as I should. I refuse to hide my feelings for you any longer; next time we are walking down a busy street and you lean over to kiss me, my lips will allow yours to kiss mine, and I will not care what others will think of us. You are a wonderful father, and I am proud that you are my husband.Love you always!",1
"I am so ashamed of the way I treated you. As I hung your clothes back up in our closet, I realized how lucky I am to still have you. I never want to see an empty space where your things should belong again. I made a big deal out of nothing and took the big things we shared for granted. I am so sorry. You have given me so much more than I ever realized. I am so thankful for what we have now, and everything we will have in the future. You are the only man I ever want to share my closet with! I know we will have to work on some things. I will do my best to make it all better. I will always love you. You will always be my one and only man.",1
"There are no words to express the gratitude I feel in my heart because our hearts have come to dwell together as one. You are my life, my heart, my soul. You are my best friend. You are my one true love. The day we met was fate. You are my destiny. I love you more today than I did yesterday, and I will love you more tomorrow than I do today. Loving you is the only thing that makes my life worth living.Please forgive me for all the hurt that I have caused you in the past. I am truly sorry for hurting you. I love you and I always will until I die. Hopefully, when that day comes, I will still have you by my side, and your angel face will be the last one I see. I want to hold you in my arms and tell you how much I love you and how much you really mean to me. I want most of all to ask for your forgiveness.",1
"I need to apologize to you. I failed you. I never meant to ruin the friendship that means the world to me. I ask for your forgiveness. If, in your heart, you find you can't forgive me, then I will understand and learn from this experience.You came into my life at a time when I needed you the most. You gave me comfort and confidence where there was doubt. I want to be there when you need to talk. I want to be the comfort for your soul. I want to love you in the way you deserve to be loved. I need you to be a part of my life. The problem was that I was willing to change who I am to please you.All the things that I told you about how I felt and how you make me feel were true. I'm sorry for hurting you.",1
"I really had a sleepless night, tossing back and forth on my bed and thinking about what happened to us that night. I didn't expect it, but I experienced the worst headache ever.We both made mistakes, not trying hard enough to understand each other. I guess we got carried away after all those arguments about whether I had an intimate relationship with someone else or not. I guess this issue has always interfered with our relationship. I know it's been hard for you to understand. Perhaps I need to give you a chance to trust me. Trust is very important, especially in a new relationship, and I have no objection to you finding out whether I have another relationship or not.I know we have both said things to each other that we both regret. I know you said you can't forgive me, neither will you forget. I regret saying what I did to you. I hope you accept my apology because I'm truly sorry for my harsh and unpleasant words.Perhaps there is the chance for us to experience again the trust we have felt for each other. One thing we must understand is that, in every relationship we're sure to experience some problems that we need to work out. We need to try to understand each other and have the trust that will make this relationship work. I know you want to work this out as much as I do. I still have my hopes and I am not giving up on our relationship.I am very sorry for hurting you last night. You caused me pain too and I'm really confused about everything. I very much want things to be stable. I want you to get all the time you need to decide what you want to do. I love you, so please never think that I can forget you. Hope to hear from you soon.",1
"I just want to thank you for all the support, love, and care you've given me. Though we've been through a lot of pain together, it doesn't matter to me. I love you very much, and I really mean it. I know it's difficult for you to decide, but whatever the outcome of our relationship, I just want you to know that I've never regretted a moment of our time together. I will cherish both the good and bad memories.I just want to say I am sorry if I hurt your feelings. I just want you to know that I'm thankful that you came into my life. I will love you for the rest of my life.Thanks for everything and take care always!",1
"I think about you every day and every night. When I'm with you, you light up my life. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I wish upon a star every night for you to return to me. The love that I hold for you in my soul is greater than an ocean or the sky above.Please forgive me for all the hurt that I have caused you. Please, I beg of you to forgive me and return back to my side like the way that it was meant to be. I love you, and I always will until the day that I die. Hopefully, when that day comes, I will still have you by my side and your angel face will be the last one that I see. I want to hold you in my arms again, and tell you how much I love you and how much you really mean to me. I love you!",1
"I didn't realize until now just how badly I mishandled our relationship. By being apart and not talking for so long, I quickly learned that you were everything I ever wanted and, by being so afraid of losing you, I ended up chasing you away by scaring you. It wasn't until now that I've realized that instead of complaining about the time I didn't have with you, I should've cherished the time I did have because it was real and filled with affection.You are always on my mind. I realize now how special it was to hear your voice.I realize I miss all the little things you do. I miss the way we look into each other's eyes and understand without saying a word. I miss the way you trust me with your children and you with mine. I miss the way you write ""I love you"" on a steamy window or mirror. I miss the way you signed to me that you love me or give me a kiss or hug while the kids aren't watching. I miss the way we joke that we are attached at the hip while fixing supper and the way we wrestle while tickling each other. I could go on and on, but you know what I'm saying. Yes, it's the little things I miss the most. The little things that I recklessly take for granted.The promise I made to you is a promise that I will keep forever, no matter what. You will always hold the prime place in my heart. Even though I'm dating here and there, I compare each one to you. You've set the bar very high for me, and that's a good thing because I refuse to settle for anything less. When I read your e-mail, it was the happiest I'd been in weeks because I regained a friend who means the world to me.Before I close, I want to sincerely say one last thing straight from my heart. I'm sorry I tried to force you to play by my rules. I realize now that what I miss the very most is you!",1
"I realize that during hard times you calm me. Sometimes, you can read my mind and then tell me exactly what I want to hear. Regardless of how much frustration there is in my life, I look forward to your voice to help me through.I wanted you to call me last night. I wanted to hear you say that I will be okay, no matter what the doctor said; that everything he said was just statistics. I wanted to hear you say that I am not a statistic. Even though I couldn't be in your arms, I wanted to believe that everything could okay, just by you saying it would. I hope that you will call me soon because I need you.I love you with all my heart.",1
"Some of our most superb feelings and warm emotions come from our love. Our world, as we have come to see it, has no boundary when our lips lock together. No one can ever sever our bond of pure affection and intimate passion. We are the angels of our own personal heaven, where we have created our own language, too. It's no longer necessary for us to speak a language of words, for true love is clearly written in our eyes.It appears that you and I have fallen in love, without even having made an effort. This is our true heaven on earth, and we are the angels who dwell upon it. I love you, my Angel.",1
"It's been over a year and somehow we've made it this far. No matter how much I screwed up, you were determined to keep our love alive. I'll never be able to thank you enough for that. Did you know that you are the reason I live, breathe, and laugh? You mean everything to me.Sometimes you ask me why I love you and I don't answer. I know you must wonder if it is because I don't love you, or that I just can't think of a reason why I love you, but that's not true. It's just that when you ask me, I don't know where to start. Our love was meant to be. There's no arguing with the destiny that brought us together.",1
I can't really find the words to explain the way I feel when I hear your voice or when I see your face. All I can say is that I love the feeling that I feel. Writing this is my way of telling you how much I truly love you.,1
"It's the end of the day and I'm thinking about you, as usual. I want you to know how much I sincerely love the times we've spent talking together. It means so much to me. It truly seems like I've known you forever, and I honestly can't imagine life without you. There will be no looking back, no second thoughts, and no regrets. I want you and need only you, and my love will only grow stronger, day after day.Sometimes life hits you with unexpected things that take you totally by surprise. All I can say is, you're the best surprise life has ever given me. Your capacity for loving, caring, and understanding never ceases to amaze me. I've truly been blessed to find you and I'll never let you go, even if I have to personally bring you back here.",1
"Hey, Honey. I miss you. I'm sitting here thinking about you like I always do. I hope you're missing me too. Sunday is almost here again. The thought of you in my arms right now sounds so good to me. I just want you to know how much I love you.I've missed you every second of my life that we're apart. I knew that I found someone special when I met you. I always think about how sweet you are and how every time my phone rings and I hear your sweet voice on the other end, I smile. I'm happy every moment we're together or when a phone call connects us.",1
"At times I can't find the words to say what I mean, so writing it down when I think about it helps me to get my point across. All I know is that you are someone I want to spend time with and have fun with, someone I want to get to know better.I don't know quite what it is about you that is so special, but I hope in some way I make you feel it too. Being in a new relationship is always a little awkward to me at first. I guess I am a little shy and lack self-confidence. Since meeting you, though, I find myself smiling more often. I actually feel more cheerful first thing in the morning, which is a new thing for me.I love to talk with you. You come to the point quickly, but you're funny, too. We don't always agree on things, but that's what keeps it interesting.Anyway, I just felt like letting you know that I am thinking of you.",1
"I am thinking about you every second of every day and cannot wait until I see you again. We should never be apart this long again. I miss your kisses and your touch. I miss you so much. I hope that I can see you soon, but until I do, I will keep you in my dreams and in my heart. Remember that I love you, and that I always will. We are lucky because we found each other a second time, and we are able to love each other more than we ever had before. I am waiting to see you again. It's only been a little over a week, but now I know that I cannot be away from you for long. I love you with all my heart.",1
"I miss you so much and cannot wait until we are together again. I know you are doing what you want and that it is important to you, so I support you in every way. I hope you also know that I will be waiting for you here with open arms and a faithful heart.You are my only love, and I pray that God in Heaven will protect you and bring you back to me soon.",1
"I was sleeping, yet my hand was searching for you, but you were not next to me. I turned my head and opened my eyes slightly to see you playing with your new computer, and I just smiled. As time went by, that would be so typical of me to do. I didn't know that you saw me sneaking glimpses of you. I turned my head to the other side and fell right back to sleep. Within minutes, I felt you beside me, only the terry cotton of your robe between us. I cuddled right up to you, like a puppy against his mother. I still wake up at times thinking of our first morning together when I smiled and you saw me and read my mind.",1
"How would I know that you were watching me sleep? I awoke to see you lying there and, just then, you smiled and said, ""Hi,"" and that just melted me. I hope with all my heart that I can wake to your beautiful eyes for the rest of my life. I hated to leave, but as I have told you before, I leave a big part of me with you whenever I go. It is yours now, so take care of it and tread lightly.I wish that I could be with you while you face so many struggles today, but please know that I am there in spirit and am praying for everything to work out for you. No matter where this life takes us, if we're together or not, know that you will always be in my heart and be my only love.",1
"It's the middle of the day and I am thinking about you, as usual. I want you to know how much I sincerely love the countless hours we spend talking. It means so much to me. It truly seems like I've known you forever, and I honestly can't imagine life without you. There will be no looking back, no second thoughts, and no regrets. I love you and only you, and that love will only grow stronger.Sometimes life hits you with unexpected things that take you totally by surprise. All I can say is that you're the best surprise life has ever given me, and your capacity for love, caring, and understanding never ceases to amaze me. I've truly been blessed by finding you and I'll never let you go.",1
"Hey, Beautiful! I just wanted to say, ""I love you"" and put that smile I love so much back on your face. I want everyone to know how much you mean to me. Ever since you entered my life, I've been floating on Cloud Nine and have not come down yet!You are the most beautiful person I know, inside and out, and I see that more clearly with each passing day. I love everything about you and about us. You do something to me that no one else can. You have made me so happy, the happiest I've ever been. You give me the most amazing feelings of being in love with you.I still don't know what I did to be so lucky to have you in my life. Our relationship is a dream come true. I am so thankful I met you. In this short time we've been together we have grown so much, and I can't wait to see what more the future holds in store for us. I love you with all my heart and soul, always and forever!",1
"I know we don't get to talk or to see each other much anymore. But being apart from you for awhile doesn't change the way I feel about you. Sure, I'm lonely, and sometimes I'm overwhelmed. But, just remember that I love you and everything about you. That's what gets me through every long day.Sweetheart, you don't know what I would give to feel your touch once more, to kiss your lips, or even just to see you again. I never loved anyone as much as I love you. You make me feel loved. You make me feel secure. More importantly, you make me feel wanted. We both knew our friendship would grow from the very first day. Neither one of us could begin to imagine the love we would both feel now. You are my soul mate, my best friend, my inspiration, and my true love.Gaining your love has been the best thing that has ever happened to me. I know that I love you and always will.",1
"I want to thank for having so much faith in me and in us as a couple. Thank you for making me a better person, and for giving your heart to me, and for opening up to me.The last six months have been wonderful. I never expected to feel this way. You are wonderful and my friends think so too, and so does my family. You make me really happy and, even though we are apart so much of the time, I love when we come together.I get butterflies in my stomach at the very thought of seeing you again. You make everything complete, and I can't imagine having these feelings for anyone else. I'm anxious to see you again. Time is ticking, and it's going by really slowly without you.You say that you are going to make me a happy woman. Well, I want you to know that you have already made me happy just by being you, by showing me love, and by being so open with your feelings. You are what I dreamed of when I was a little girl--someone with integrity, honesty, good looks, and a caring personality. I never thought I would find you, but here you are.I love you so much, and can't wait to be with you again. I want to give you my heart and soul. I don't care about anything else in the world because I am only in love with you. Thank you for making all of my dreams come true. I could not ask for anything more. I am the luckiest girl in the world to be called your girlfriend. I'm truly honored. Thank you. I love you.",1
"You are the most intelligent, handsome man I have ever met and I have been so blessed to have you in my life. We have had our share of drama, I know, but you will always mean the world to me.I can't wait until I have the chance to hold you in my arms again. You're the most wonderful man in the world. I know I sometimes frustrate you but I long for nothing else than to keep you happy. You're always in my thoughts and in my heart.",1

"  No, blacks were not given access to credit and property in the manner that whites were due to racism. In the 60's many black neighborhoods were destroyed to make the interstate highway system, the replacement was high density public housing. In 68, when king died blacks destroyed their own commercial centers, but these were OWNED by whites and rented to blacks. That was part of the anger, to this day most of these places are still just as they were after the riots. In combination with the drugs that were imported into the cities by Regean to destroy the black pride movement, these things destroyed confidence and morale in the black community, causing them to blame the man. Most of the children from the 70's grew up to be either cynical adults, or backstabbers to the ppl they left behind when they made it, like Barrack and Michelle Obama.",0

"Stanley Kubrick, and seeing ""Clockwork Orange"" as a teenager were what made me start to study film as a potential art form, not just the Hollywood products shoved into release dates that I was used to up until that point (and that, more and more, movies tend towards now). It was just so unique and powerful, and in a way, through its own antisocial nature, it gave me the strength to get through those uncertain high school years, where I often felt caged up and institutionalized like Alex. A lot of people didn't understand it, wrote it off as too weird or disturbing (which it is, certainly was at the time, though times have changed), but then it's not meant to be a family film. I wrote like 2 papers on it in college.    Although I for one think filmmakers are far too casual with releasing Special Edition DVD versions of movies these days, there's one movie where it'd be really nice to see just that, so we might have something with promotional materials and essays and documentaries detailing its influence and transition to the screen, and with any luck, a commentary by Malcolm McDowell and Jan Harlan detailing their thoughts about it, and Kubrick himself (RIP, Stan).",0

"VIVA la RESISISTANCE(but4real this time dude) Body: Is It Time for a Rebellion? October 20, 2008 ""50 percent NO and 50 percent HELL NO!""--Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va. ) on feedback received from his constituents regarding Congress' bailout package Mere days after President Bush signed into law an $810 billion bailout bill aimed at rescuing the Wall Street financiers, one of the recipients, American International Group Inc., threw a $440,000 bash for its executives at a swanky resort, complete with spa treatments, banquets and golf outings. At the same time that AIG execs were celebrating lavishly, indirectly at taxpayer expense, nearly 12 million American taxpayers, who owed more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, were in danger of foreclosure. As if it weren't bad enough that a fiscally irresponsible corporate America is going to be bailed out at taxpayer expense, Congress included more than $100 billion in pork barrel projects in the bill. Nothing short of congressional bribes, these so-called inducements range from an exemption from excise tax for wooden arrows designed for use by children and tax write-offs for motorsports racing track facility owners to tax rebates on rum imported from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, as well as imported wool. This is not relief, it is economic slavery. It has become increasingly clear that the greatest threat to our freedoms--and our bank accounts--does not lurk outside our borders. Rather, it prowls among us, in the form of a government of wolves that is running wild and riding roughshod over our freedoms. There was a time when such a blatant disregard for the burden being laid upon the American taxpayer would have elicited howls of outrage, protest marches and perhaps even outright rebellion. Today, however, many Americans understandably feel helpless to do anything about their plight. After all, despite the fact that calls and emails to congressional offices were overwhelmingly against the $810 billion pork-laden bailout, the legislation passed anyway. Yet consider this: at its core, the quest for the American dream is about gaining sovereignty over one's life and property. Without it, there can be no freedom. While we have become accustomed to equating property with land ownership, the term is much more fundamental and personal. It refers to a kind of sovereignty over one's life and possessions--especially one's money. Questions about who has ultimate control over our money, how much of it can be claimed by government and how it gets spent go to the heart of the battle over property rights. Governments generate no wealth on their own. Any resources that they have at their disposal have been appropriated from the original producers of that wealth, the citizens. This fundamental truth has largely been forgotten over the years. Yet the government's respect for and treatment of the property of its citizens often reflects its attitude regarding its citizens' rights as a whole. Conversely, a government that doesn't respect the rights of its citizens will have even less regard for their property--be it land, money or personhood. With the Wall Street bailout, the President and Congress simply disregarded the clear will of the people. And while secret agreements were obviously made and backroom bargains struck, the Constitution and our rights were not even given a second thought. However, those who wrote the Constitution drafted our founding document with the intention of ensuring that the power of government remained with the people. The Framers wanted citizens to know what the government is doing and how it spends taxpayer funds. And if the elected officials aren't doing their jobs or the people disagreed with their performance, the Framers empowered the people to unseat their representatives. Without these safeguards, there is no representative government. Since the country's inception, America has been synonymous with the concept that there are certain individual rights and freedoms that no one, not even government agents, can violate. As the Declaration of Independence boldly proclaims: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. "" These were revolutionary ideas in an age of kings and serfdoms, and they served as a springboard for the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. These rights were considered absolute and so precious that no government can violate them. And the early American colonists believed these principles were not only worth fighting for, they were worth dying for. One of these was the right of the people to change or do away with a government that attempts to undermine their rights. As the Declaration concludes, ""whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. "" Governments are brought into being to protect our rights. When they systematically violate them, the people have a right--nay, a duty--to resist. This was the true spirit of 1776 that moved the American colonists to start a revolution against a government that was violating their rights. This willingness to stand and fight against corrupt government was what it meant to be an American in our nation's early years. And if we truly want to be Americans today, it will mean practicing every form of nonviolent resistance available to us as citizens--including picketing, mass protests, sit-ins, boycotts and so on. It will certainly take more than voting for or against a particular politician. Thomas Jefferson was right: ""What country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to time, that this people preserve the spirit of resistance?"" Available online at: http://www. rutherford. org/articles_db/commentary. asp?record_id=559 Exactly dude thats what i been tripping on for to long!! we have to take action its getting worse all the time!!! any ideas for putting together a meeting of some sort? maybe finding hella people who see it like that too so we can all change this country back to what we were supposed to stand up for, so we represent and stand for what we were meant to stand up for. how often are elections started with an idea that we, the actual people, has decided? we are brain washed into believing we are making the important decisions when in all actualites THEY,[the ""president""(our king) and his noble mary men(the government end elected political officials] give US preselected canidates to vote on so ""we"" choose witch of the presented options THEY give US. So they this play mind-fuck game where people truely do believe we as the worlds free people are together deciding through this little""what do u wanna do huny? u decide""ol' trick: much like a parent gives a child, you can pick!! a., b., c., or d. its YOUR decision you pick... WITHOUT TELLING ANYONE: not even in fine print, BUT if u read BETWEEN the LINES it clearly is almost like saying ya go ahead and vote for WHOMEVER YOU WANT but they just cant say that or the mindpower/control will be lost. they have SOOO MANY DISTRACTIONs to keep us all happy and busy and do just what they want. they very treat us like we are all individual crazy/guilty persons while the finger remains pointed at us for fear we may turn it around they create laws to keep the majority of us behind bars or hiding indoors for fear of police whom intarigate, harrass and search with no warning at any time for whatever reasons they make up. the country we live in today is not close to what it was created for nor anywhere near compariable to what our founding fathers intended this place to be like. it is almost as if we are commited to kings and its 16th century london but only with technology, womens rights and a grip more rules to follow. emily: It seems like people r 2 rapped up n their own lives to pay attention or even fight whats going on. People r scared to lose their jobs. So many people, r concerned about irrelevant things. So, when u think u found others whom u could join and get some type of march going, they throw in unrelated issues like abortion or whose gonna win the election. We needed to stop this before the election, by the time the election come whats done is done That is true but we as the people need to put a stop to the madness we need to stand together they need us like we need them.",0

"Gas prices did go down. Or better said, the gas guzzlers went down south... of the border.   The US and Mexican press had a field day sensationalizing the events for several months, which in turn greatly affected tourism and Bajaâs economy as over 40 percent of the Baja coastal region depends on tourism. Baja has experienced the economic pain that also punctuates for them the great binational economic interdependence.  Now it seems that despite the media fervor in reporting and sensationalizing Mexicoâs problems with drug capos, Americans are flocking back to Baja. Why?  Saving money, trumps fear. Gasoline prices now over $4.50 a gallon in San Diego is available anywhere in Baja for around $2.55 a gallon. And the stampede of US trucks buying diesel fuel at $2.20 a gallon versus over $5 a gallon in San Diego, has caught Baja shorthanded an unable to keep up with the demand. Once again the economic interdependence is evident.  Robert Kline from Orange County waiting to fuel up his Ford pickup said that once he began reading and seen on nightly news about all the cars crossing for gas, he figured things canât be that bad, so he decided to come back to Baja that was his favorite weekend retreat. Like Kline, others are beginning to see that things are OK, and they too will begin to travel to Baja. So things will go back to normal during the summer months.  http://hispanicvista.com/HVC/Columnist/posiojr/070608Patrick_Osi o.htm  BTW Mexico's gas prices go up only by inflation rate, where here in the US they are set by the individual sellers (companies).",0

"  I didn't say all republicans are racist, what I said rather, was that the republican party has a history of racism. Also, the republican party is in denial about this and this is exactly why most blacks will not vote for a republican.  If you read the article, the author suggests that it is a good thing that Bush is reaching out to black voters finally, but it will not work until the republican party adresses it's racism in the past.  I've yet to hear a good reason for Reagan to deliver his initial campaign speech, repleat with overtones of states rights vs federal rights, in Philadelphia, MI, the exact town in which three civil rights workers were murdered in one of the 1960s' ugliest cases of racist violence. It was a ringing declaration of his support for ""states' rights"" â a code word for resistance to black advances clearly understood by white Southern voters.  If this wasn't race baiting, what was it? Please explain.",0

Opposite of subprime  CRA-motivated loans tend to be the opposite of subprime loans, most of which were issued by mortgage brokers and mortgage companies and financed by investment banks, none of which were covered by the CRA.  Here's more evidence that you've been hoodwinked. This information was collected by the Center for Responsible Lending:  â¢ The CRA was effective long before the subprime market existed.  â¢ The CRA has been around for three decades and the financial instruments that allowed the subprime mortgage industry to rise and crash came into existence within the past five years.  â¢ Investment banks, not the federal government, had the appetite for risky loans.  The Wall Street-based market for reselling subprime created the demand for riskier loans. Because the debt would be sold into the market and not kept on the lender's books, many lenders did not bother to verify a borrower's income or assess ability to repay the loan.",0

" I didn't say that you voted for Olmert.ÃÂ  No, you aren't supposed to assassinate Olmert. Or Livni.ÃÂ  All I said is that he is even more unpopular than Bush and Israel can't get rid of the sleeze.ÃÂ  He has too much protexia to give away to keep the Knesset from dumping him.  I only voted for Bush the second time.ÃÂ  The first time, I voted for Gore.ÃÂ   Gore and Kerry would have been worse than Bush - worse than Clinton even.ÃÂ  That is the opinion of the american public.ÃÂ  Obama would be a worldwide disaster as well.  Bush was a bad choice for president because:  * He can't speak off the cuff - a requirement for a national leader.  * He made Condi Rice Secretary of State.  * He hasn't released information on terrorism and the war in Iraq that would justify many of his actions.  The U.S. lost in Vietnam because the leftist press turned the country agaisnt the war, calling the Tet offensive a win for the NVA when it was a huge loss.ÃÂ  They are trying to do the same in Iraq.  If you want to know what is going on with the extreme left in the U.S., allow me to sendÃÂ you private messages.       To equate Bush with Hitler, Stalin and Mao is kind of nuts.",0

"Hollywood is seeing the Bollywood effect at the moment. The architect about how a movie comes to be made has changed drastically in Hollywood over the last decade. Churn out lots of movies and they only have to be ok in quality. Turn a modest profit at the box office because the B.O. is now a secondary revenue stream to the direct sell-through DVD, PPV, Foreign Distribution and cable TV markets.  Hollywood used to be a talent based industry -- Audiences would go see movies for the talent (actors; directors) even more than they do now. However, now it is a packaged goods industry on the studio side where talent takes a back seat to the movie itself (the high concept), and why marketing the movie is more important than anything else. A movie's main theatrical run is now just a 110 minute commercial for the eventual DVD release where it can make 10x its B.O. take.  Teens still go to the movies each weekend which throws a whole other dimension into the mix and is why most of the products offered cater to this demographic.  So... How does this explain movies just being not as good as the ones in previous years from a strictly business perspective?  The emphasis isn't on quality anymore. It's on quantity.  There will be 100 movies, big and small, coming out this summer of 2008. That's just a four month period (May-August). Consider how many movies come out PER YEAR (in the U.S.) and this is proof the focus is now on market saturation and not the quality of the product. Also, consider over half (50%) of those movies released each year are remakes and or based on previously proven properties like novels and comic books.  Studios can get away with this approach because a lot of these movies aren't made for very much, so when they do strike B.O. gold -- Like ""Juno"" -- They can maximize the profits.  Most of your smaller movies have budgets of less than $40 million which is why they can afford to fail at the B.O. because they will easily make that back through DVD rentals. These days, there are only a few, tent pole pictures studios are willing to sink a lot of money ($100-$300 million per picture) into. These are your franchise pictures like the household comic book movies, high concept stuff like ""Transformers"" etc. -- Properties that coincidentally also have cross-promotional tie-ins (toys, video games, fast food, cell phone, etc.) to help finance the films.  It is this emphasis on quantity that is effecting what is produced, movies don't have to be ""good"" anymore. They just have to be on the market and interest you in the DVD. Because once you buy or rent the DVD, even if the movie ""sucks"" you've already spent your money and that is what the studios and theater owners want.  But to say all movies are garbage this decade is pure idiocy. This decade has seen many future classics in their respected genres...from all around the world.",0

  Well that is a good example of a black voter taking control of the situation rather than being controlled by the situation. I just ask this question just in case it might turn out that way. I just hope black voters will still turn out for Hillary even though it has been a rough primary. Hillary really did not have a choice but to be on the offensive against Obama and throw the kitchen sink at him due to the fact that Obama did take her by surprise with overwhelming victories after Super Tuesday. But it is definitely in Obama's favor right now to be the nominee. Good luck to all candidate.,0

"The original ""The Wicker Man""   THE 1973 ORIGINAL VERSION NOT the Remake.     I didn't see the remake but Im going to assume this was the ending:  Nicholas Cage jumps out of the wicker man at the last moment that its burning, performs Krag Maga on the village leader and several of the other pagans, disarming his gun taking it and grabbing the girl, Nick C. then gets into a car for a long car chase sequence with villagers in pursuit in their cars, with a hail of bullets following him, he crashes through a random fruit stand. Drives under a semi-truck, turning the car into a convertable, the cars following him crash into it. Then he slams into a firetruck which explodes. It seems like all is lost as the pagans surround a bruised and tattered and burned Nick Cage trapped in his car. Then the sound of helicopter blades:  Miraculously the ATF shows up in helicopters. ATF paratroupers leap out on rope ladders. The ATF burns the entire town to the ground like Waco. At the end of the movie a battlescarred Nickolas Cage, exhausted out of breath, gets praised by the leading ATF Commander (who is also Nick's dad) something like ""Good job son, sorry I doubted you in Waco""   Then the credits roll, and some lame rap music plays with these lyrics: ""Wicka, wicka, wicka; my n$gga, n$gga, n$gga""",0

Although I think there's too much attention paid to The Empire Strikes Back, which I do not view as a groundbreaking film, sorry.  Time Code is a cheap gimmick movie, and very hard to watch for more than 10 minutes.  Requiem for a Dream is not the first anti-drug movie.  And, as groundbreaking films go, where was Citizen Kane?  I would have also mentioned Metropolis, M, The Day the Earth Stood Still, 2001, Dr. Strangelove, Anatomy of a Murder, Blade Runner, Rope, and several silent films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari & The Passion of Joan of Arc if I was talking about films with a notable influence years after they were made.",0

As far as Training Day, anyone pretty much could step right into that role. Yes I have seen it and still to this day wonder why anyone can see it as a great film. Ethan Hawk is a great actor? When did this happen? Not sure we watched the same film or is it the age gap?    Malcolm X,  You first need to realise and understand, was a real person. All you need to do with when portraying a real person is impersonate them. There is plenty of footage of the real person to study from. He did not create a character, he impersonated a person. Maybe its just me but there is enough drama in real life to sit down and watch someone else's drama on film. I tried watching Malcolm X and just couldnt do it, boring and just uninteresting to me personaly but o each their own.    Pretty much any actor will tell you, drama is easy, comedy is hard.",0

A lot of fans my age say that the saturation of too many new Transformers ruined Generation 1 and made it get cancelled. I don't think so. I think it was the saturation of Daniel being used too much, too many times when the parents were the focus of attention, then they did what Star Trek and Return Of The Jedi made mistakes with, they brought in too many different alien species, which has the same effect as too many humans. The attention was taken away from the Transformers.",0

I didn't want to debate her in the mall so I didn't say anything, but I think there obviously is a cultural significance, but I don't know if its a Jackie Robinson type of accomplishment. His accomplishment was ending the ban on black players. Obama isn't breaking down a legal barrier, but it is a social barrier.

"This is a rather fun one that I always wanted to do. Even though most winners at science fairs are biology projects this one is still way cool and is a physics one.    You measure the speed of light. Here is what you need a microwave (without the automatic turn table), some chocolate or cheese, an accurate ruler (measurements in milimeters), a plate.    What you do is break up the cheese or chacolate and spread it up along the plate. Put it in the microwave and turn it on... observe it and wait for small parts of it to melt. This phenomina happens because the microwaves which are inside your microwave oven form a standing wave. This is why you have to stir food in it to cook it or have a turn table, or have you ever noticed how one bit will be real hot, and then the bite right next to it will be ice cold? The goal is to let it form a few hot spots that melt the cheese in those places. Then you want to take a ruler and measure the distance between each of the hotspots. You now know the wavelength of microwaves, it will be best to convert this length into meters (it will be like .005 meters or something like that though) . Now to figure out the speed of light    c = speed of light (electromagnetic radiation)  l = wavelength of the light  f = frequency of the light    The equation is as follows    c = l*f    You measured l, now to get f, look on the back of the microwave and look for the frequency of the waves. It will probably be in MHz or something like that (I don't remember the frequencies of microwaves off the top of my head). Mulitply l times f and you have just figured out the speed of light!",0

I've come up against several men of power in my life who are inherently sexist, but I have never failed to get what I wanted because I never let them regard me in a lower way. I think if you have enough respect for yourself and a general air of confidence, you can get most things done.  This is probably because I grew up training horses with guys though. You can whine, bitch, and moan.  I think women are definitely at a disadvantage because there is a high percentage who rely on being cute to get their way... which can work to an extent, but not in a way which will earn you any kind of respect in the future.

He's been handled with the utmost of care since he made the switch to mma and became EliteXC's cash cow that appeals to the white, suburban gangster demographic. He was scheduled to fight the corpse of a light heavyweight that hasn't won a fight in close to 10 years. He instead got knocked out by a man that weighed 30 lbs less standing on one foot.  mma.tv has a .gif of Shaw screaming that Kimbo was being hit in the back of the head when Slice was already staring up at the lights. Truly, it has made my day  http://webpages.charter.net/gline/skala-kimbo_seth-juggo.gif",0

I never had any illusions about him. I thought that at best, he'd have a 10-4 or 12-6 record at 38. Slice has never even had an amateur career and he's going up against guys who've been doing it their entire lives. he was SUPPOSED to be fighting tomato cans. everybody demanded that he fight stiffer competition to justify the personna that Elite XC manufactured or magnified for him. i wasn't a supporter because I bought into that hype. the fight world and entertainment in general has always been plagued by that kind of hypocrisy. good fiction outsells reality in every genre.",0

Especially when the UN says, ""No, you can't invade iraq"", and the US says ""Too bad, what are you going to do?"" Sicne that IS basically how it went down.  The US government does what it wants, regardless of what the UN wants. The US only ""abides"" by the UN when it's convenient for them. It's a big fucking joke.

"  I will admit I would love to see a KOTOR movie but it will not happen until George Lucas sells his rights. I will also go on to admit that Epsidoe 1 n 2 were not so impressive and thankfully Epsiode 3 was THE best in the prequels. The fact Episode 3 took a darker turn was THE best choice for the final installment. Also it isn't George Lycas' fault he cannot direct anymore. Before agreeing to Write/direct Episode 1,2 and 3, George Lucas hasn't directed since Episode 4 which was released in 1977.  After Epsidoe 4 he just produced the Indiana Jones Trilogy and along with Star Wars Episode 5 and 6. It was a shame that Episode 1 n 2 weren't that good but at least they were decent. I still have yet to see The Clone Wars show so there is no telling if George Lucas gotten worse or a tad bit better.  Anyhow I personally think a Force Unleashed film would work if handled right",0

" Another reason they go through it is to weed out weaklings. Steal-your assertion that ""anyone who swims or surfs alot can easily beat this"" is completely ridiculous. Do you really think this is where the interrogation stops if no information is obtained? They go straight from waterboarding to beatings and electric shocks. The difference with this video, and the training of our military personnel, is that the training eventually stops. The torture to extract information does not.  I'd really like to see any of the dumbasses in here who support this go through it just once. They'd admit to having sex with their own mother or father to make it stop. ESPECIALLY if they didn't know what was coming next. Could be freedom, could be jumper cables attached to their testicles. They'd say anything to get the first, and they'd say anything to prevent the second. That's why torture has been proven time and time again to not get the real information you need. Gaining a prisoner's trust and extracting information through more subversive measures is far more likely to get the desired results.",0

"Palin drags down Republican ticket By DAVID LIGHTMAN SarahPalin has become a drag on the Republican presidential ticket, thefirst time in recent political history that a running mate has madesuch a difference. Among many independents and moderate Republicans,she's raised serious questions about John McCain's judgment, become toomuch of a national punch line and reinforced concerns about McCain'sage. ""Nice lady, no experience. It's so sad. She's a giganticdrag,"" said Chris DePino, a Republican consultant based in New Haven,Conn. The Alaska governor does help the ticket somewhat byenergizing hard-core Republicans, but polls suggest that overall ""she'shurting John McCain,"" said Andrew Kohut, the president of the PewResearch Center. In a nationwide survey Oct. 16-19, Pew foundthat 49 percent of respondents had unfavorable views of Palin, while 44percent saw her favorably. A month earlier, 54 percent had seen herfavorably and 32 percent viewed her negatively. Typically,post-election polls find that vice-presidential choices sway about 1percent of voters. This time, Kohut said, ""we'll get a much biggernumber."" A key reason is that ""the Palin choice reflects poorlyon Senator McCain's judgment,"" said vice presidential expert JoelGoldstein, a professor of law at St. Louis University. Pew foundthat 41 percent of respondents thought McCain showed ""poor judgment""overall, while 29 percent said that of Democratic nominee Barack Obama.While McCain's number isn't solely because of his choice of Palin, herselection was a factor. McCain's age is also a reason for voters'concern about Palin. The Arizona senator is 72 and has had fourinstances of melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer. MayoClinic physicians have posted a detailed explanation of McCain'scondition and treatment on his Web site. The prognosis, they said, was""good."" Worries linger, however. ""If something happened toMcCain, she would not be qualified to step in and be president,"" saidAnnette Barron, an independent voter from Altamonte Springs, Fla. Palinalso has hurt herself by becoming largely invisible to the generalpublic, except when she got media attention for starting controversies- such as charging that Obama was ""palling around with terrorists"" - orfor receiving $150,000 in clothing and accessories from the RepublicanParty. She also unabashedly identifies herself with the party's conservative wing, alienating moderates. ""Itreinforced the notion that John McCain cared little about people likeme,"" said former Maine state Rep. Sherry Huber, a Republican who backedMcCain in the primary but now supports Obama. ""She clearly does notshare the values I and other moderate Republicans do."" ProminentRepublicans have echoed that idea. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one ofMcCain's closest friends, suggested that Sen. Joseph Lieberman, anindependent Democrat from Connecticut, would have brought independentsto the ticket. Last week, former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge said thathad McCain picked him, the Republican Party would have had a bettershot at winning his state. Then there's Palin's image problembecause of what vice-presidential expert Timothy Walch called ""thealbatross of American comedy."" ""Every time (comedian) Tina Feyappeared on TV imitating her, it diminished Palin,"" said Walch, thedirector of the Herbert Hoover presidential library. ""For somebodyessentially unknown, she's diminished when she becomes a caricature ofherself."" In most election years, Palin would have been afootnote, like controversial vice-presidential choices Spiro Agnew in1968 or Dan Quayle 20 years later. Both were lightly regarded buttriumphed on winning tickets. However, Goldstein, of St. LouisUniversity, noted that in 1968, Richard Nixon was 55, so the prospectof an Agnew presidency seemed dim. In 1988, Quayle ran with George H.W.Bush, who was essentially running for President Reagan's third termagainst unpopular Democrat Michael Dukakis. In 2008, Goldsteinsaid, Obama ""has convinced a broad cross-section of the American peoplehe's presidential,"" so Palin gives swing voters who are warming to theIllinois senator one more reason to move away from McCain. As forPalin's expected appeal to women, Sieglinde Warren, a teachingsupervisor from Poland, Ohio, was a Clinton supporter who now backsObama. Palin and Clinton don't compare, she said, because ""Clinton hadsome substance I could relate to."" (EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM) Tobe sure, Palin has had some positive impact on the campaign. McCain hadnever been a favorite of strict conservatives, as he challengedRepublican orthodoxy over the years on tax cuts, campaign finance,climate change and other topics. The Republican base loves Palin. ""Somany people can relate to her. She really appeals to everydayhousewives, people who go out and hunt, and people who have done greatthings in their life,"" said Bob Dodge, a retired communicationsengineer in Sarasota, Fla. And don't tell Jennifer Tarman, aBradenton, Fla., medical assistant, that Palin, who's been a governorsince December 2006, isn't qualified. ""She's more qualified thanObama,"" she said. Obama's been a U.S. senator since January 2005, buthas spent most of the past two years campaigning for the White House. Still, the experts and a lot of swing voters agree with Goldstein. ""She's made it much more difficult for McCain,"" he said. ON THE WEB John McCain's medical records: http://www.johnmccain.com/mccainrecords/",0

"i suspect that it's an accurate portrayal    of the bloodlust that existed in the real    lives of those ancient people >>>    The Aztecs were few in number compared to neighboring tribes, so war games that ended in human sacrifice meant fewer enemies.

With all the violence in our movies, the average American probably sees more blood spilled in violence (alibet fake) than anyone else on the planet, now or in the past.    Bill",0

"Now mexico wants to control our laws? Either mexico should keep their people on their side or their leaders should be assassinated! Damn, I hate that country!   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico - Mexico is protesting the execution of one of its citizens in Texas despite a world court ruling for a new hearing, expressing concern for the rights of other Mexicans detained in the United States.  Mexico's Foreign Relations Department said it sent a note of protest to the State Department about Jose Medellin's case, which drew international attention because of allegations that Medellin wasn't allowed to consult the Mexican consulate for legal help following his arrest.  Texas executed Medellin, 33, late Tuesday for the 1993 rape and killing of two teenage girls in Houston.  Medellin was convicted of participating in the gang rape, beating and strangling of Elizabeth Pena, 16, and Jennifer Ertman, 14. Prosecutors said he and five fellow gang members attacked the girls as they were walking home on a June night, raped and tortured them for an hour, then kicked and stomped them before using a belt and shoelaces to strangle them.  ""I'm sorry my actions caused you pain. I hope this brings you the closure that you seek. Never harbor hate,"" Medellin said to those gathered to watch him die. ""Never harbor hate.""  In Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, where Medellin was born, a small group of his relatives condemned the execution.  ""This is another murder because no one has the right to take someone else's life, only God,"" said Medellin's cousin Reyna Armendariz.  A large black bow and a banner that read ""No to the death penalty ... may God forgive you,"" hung from an iron fence in the front of the house where Medellin lived before moving to the United States at the age of 3.  Armendariz said the family hopes Medellin's body would be return to Mexico.  ""He signed a paper saying he wanted his remains to go to a friend. Who knows if they will bring him here,"" Armendariz said sobbing.  The Mexican government statement said officials ""were concerned for the precedent that (the execution) may create for the rights of Mexican nationals who may be detained in that country.""  An international court ruled in 2004 that the convictions of Medellin and 50 other Mexicans on death row around the United States violated the Vienna Convention, which calls for people arrested abroad to have access to their home country's consular officials.  Texas state officials say Medellin didn't ask to do so until well after he was convicted of capital murder.  The International Court of Justice, also known as the world court, said the Mexican prisoners should have new court hearings to determine whether the violation affected their cases.  President Bush asked states to review the cases, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier this year neither the president nor the international court can force Texas to wait.",0

"A 70-year-old Israeli woman in the southern village of Yesha has been killed by a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip, Israeli officials have said.  The rocket scored a direct hit on her house in the small farming community.  She is the second Israeli civilian to be killed by rocket or mortar fire from Gaza in less than a week.  The latest death comes as Egypt is trying to mediate a truce between Israel and Hamas, the militant Palestinian group which controls Gaza.  The head of Egyptian intelligence, Omar Suleiman, has been in Israel for talks with political leaders.  Last month the plans were given the backing of a dozen Palestinian factions including, Hamas - which has controlled Gaza since last year - and the Fatah movement of President Mahmoud Abbas.  Israel said any truce agreement must include the release of a captured Israeli soldier and an end to arms smuggling into Gaza.  The Israeli military launches frequent air strikes or incursions into Gaza in an attempt to stop the frequent rocket fire from the territory into southern Israel.  Mortar fire from Gaza killed an Israeli man on Friday in the kibbutz of Kfar Aza. Three people were wounded.  Israeli air strikes then killed five members of Hamas.  The Gaza Strip has been controlled by Hamas since last June when they ousted their rivals from the Fatah movement.   Story from BBC NEWS:",0

"   Take a world economics class, then delve into the finer points of the Defense Budget. For example, the U.S. doesn't own any of the land in the countries it has forces stationed (peacefully or otherwise). The land is rented. In Germany money is paid to the German Government every time a military vehicle is driving off of the installation. The German Government is paid a fee every time a hole is dug on the military installation itself, too. Same thing with the use of the rifle range. Let's not even get into the millions of dollars spent every year by the troops themselves within the country (the alcohol purchase alone would fund a couple of social programs here in the U.S.).  When we first set up the airbase in Hungary in support of the Operation Joint Endeavor in 1995 we almost tripled two-thirds of the country's Gross National Product.  South Korea actually only pays about 20% of their defense budget; we handle the rest in accordance of their treaty. If we were to just up and leave, they'd have to make up that last 80% in the face of North Korea's ""million man army.""  Need more examples?",0

"I think men and women are mostly equal, but woman usually don't have as much power as men because of three things:   1: Woman are more likely to have less time to gain rank, they spend more time on education, family, etc. and they spend more money, money = time lost.  2: Woman are less likely to use force in order to get what they want.  3: Woman care about other peoples' feelings too much, they are less likely to get rid of people who are in their way.  Basically the percentage of woman who ""play nice"" is higher than the percentage of men who do. Also they focus on education more than men. (the education system actually tends to hold people back in life --- it's hard to prove due to the fact that the corporations think otherwise, without corp./gov. backing it would be obvious though.)",0

That the poor elderly will no longer suffer under the unfulfillable greed of insurance or hospital HMO's. That the dream of Americanism has now been given to those willing to work for it, and not in the hands of the Fortune 500 executives. Prosperity, growth, and equality have been returned to the great justice that is the USA.  No more religious oppression, no more religious division, no more governmental failures of misunderstanding. Tonight, America has joined together and spoke with one monstrous roar, that equality doesn't just stop at law.

He enlisted with the same foreknowledge.  There is no draft. enlistment is NOT mandatory. If you dont want to uphold the oath you must take to enlist, DONT ENLIST. No one forced them to enter the service.  To most people who are clueless about war, there is NO children. There is NO Women.  When compassion enters into it, you DIE. you team members DIE.  You are no less dead from being shot by a 10 year old then you are from anyone else. WE learned that lesson well in vietnam. 5 year olds walk into a group of GI's and detonate a grenade becuase the ""enemy"" taught them to.  I woudl have to disagree with some of the IRAQ ""vets"" howver who claim you are tuaght to kill everything if you recieve fire. This is catergorically incorrect. just as law enforcement are taught to identify threats so are soldiers taught to do the same.

"  Well George Lucas swore that there would NEVER be an Epsiode 7,8 and 9 and concidering that Mark Hamill is old now just leaves out the possibility right there as well. Reason I think The Force Unleashed would work is because the story is right there. The story is actually in between the Episodes and is explained well on what happened to the Jedi and who finished them off.  I beaten the game and do believe that alot of the segments would work well in the movie. The part where the secret apprentice takes down a Star Destroyer with his force powers would deffinitally work well in the film as so would his fights against the Jedi he was tasked to kill. Also the ending sequence would most certainly make the film as well if it does happen.  I still have yet to see The Clone Wars movie and TV show and am awaiting the live action Bounty Hunter series due in 2011 but if there is any TRUE Star Wars film to be made it would have to be The Force Unleashed in my own opinion.",0

I'm a staunch isolationist; always have been.  However, what I like and don't like doesn't change the facts. I'm willing to make the sacrifices necessary to withdraw into our shells and take care of ourselves first, but I can't make that choice for the rest of the country (which is why I will never run for office).

"1.Cannibal Holocaust The film was banned in countless countries, and Deodato actually had to show evidence, in court, that the film was indeed fake, even going so far as to bring the actors on a popular TV talk show in Italy to prove they were still alive.  2. Men Behind the Sun To be honest, this film could be 100% fictional and it still would have made the top 10 list, as some of the scenes are downright brutal and extremely controversial: a (supposedly real) live cat is thrown into a room of starving rats and torn to pieces; a (supposedly real) corpse of a boy is slowly autopsied; a man is placed in a pressure chamber until his intestines blow out of his anus; a woman is tied to a post outside in the freezing cold, with buckets of cold water being dumped over her head to test the effects of frostbite, then her hands are plunged into boiling hot water, the skin peeling right off the bones; etc etc  3.Guinea Pig: Flower of Flesh and Blood The film itself is fairly simple: a creepy Japanese dude in a samurai suit (donât ask us) kidnaps a girl, drugs her, ties her to a bed, and slowly cuts her to pieces. Thatâs it, thatâs the whole movie. But the special effects are SO well done and so convincing, it really takes it to a whole other level. Fingers, hands, you name it; everything is cut off in slow, agonizing detail. The blood looks great, the gore is splendid, and the dismemberments are top notch (for example, after cutting off one of her hands, the fingers suddenly clench around his wrist, despite the fact it is no longer attached. Yikes.). 4. Cutting Moments Cutting Moments is a disquieting, harrowing look at the mental breakdown and subsequent downward spiral of a family torn apart by abuse, both physical and mental, and the limits of the human psyche. A mostly silent and slow-paced film, thereâs no denying the talent behind Cutting Moments, as Buck masterfully lets silence speak louder then words; allowing the tension of the film to slowly rise to a boil before the incredibly disturbing and permanently scarring bloody climax.  5. Aftermath Aftermath pushes the boundaries of the genre in ways few films even dream of. Nacho Cerda made the film as part of a trilogy, focusing on death, post-death, and rebirth. Aftermath (the 2nd film in the trilogy) shows how we are all at the mercy of others once we die; our bodies nothing more then husks of meat to be poked, prodded, and disassembled.

But hey, at least the victim is not stabbed to death then disemboweled or forced to pee on herself. The I Spit rapists are real humanitarians. The movie itself was not as bad as I remembered it. In fact, while I guess it's really impossible to say you liked or enjoyed a film like this, I must say this is a decent film. The acting was good, and the story was ok. The DVD edition I rented cleaned up the picture beautifully. There's no way I saw a version as pristine as this when I saw it at the drive-in or on vhs 20+ years ago. All the dvd extras were great. Original reviews were available including two I remember very well, from Siskel(RIP) and my man Ebert, that caused it to be removed from the old United Theater here in Chicago. The director of the film gives an interesting commentary and tells about an actual event in his own life that he says inspired him to tell the story. I'd actually have to go against the guys and give this film a marginal thumbs up. The dvd as a package is very good and kudos to the director for not doing a musical score.",0

"  The problem with using popular voting as a definitive method of making decisions about representatives. . .is that the popular vote is VERY easy to f*ck with. Given the motivation, it's really simple for someone to submit dozens of ballots using a falsified identity with each one. Since it's effectively illegal to make people provide identification when voting(and I agree with this, btw), it's makes for very skewed elections. Of course, that might not happen every time. . .but why take the risk?  I'm not saying that I agree with the Electoral College, either, since it has its own flaws.

"  Well James Earl Jones is still alive and could do the vocal work for Darth Vader. In the past films other people filled in for the suit and James Earl Jones just did the voice over work on the character. I think the story could work for many reasons. One reason is that George Lucas produced and okayed the story for the game so if there is actually a movie he would okay the movie script since he was involved closely with the game.  Also the film could fit in really well into the saga. The reason the secret apprentice wasn't mentioned in Episode 4-6 is because he was a ""secret"" apprentice. Noone was allowd to know of his existence which makes logical sense as well. I think the film could work and possibly go into production in the coming years. The Episodes may be done but doesn't mean there can't be side story films to be made.  As for the TV series. George Lucas and his producer Rick Maccallum said recently that the 2 are sitting down with TV writers to get the much anticipated Star Wars live action show underway. So far what is said about the TV show is it won't have Jedi or even Darth Vader in it and would more or less focus on Bounty Hunters like bobba Fett.

" White House: North Korea Assisted Syria On Nuclear Reactor Destroyed By Israel   White House: Syria Must 'Come Clean' About Nukes (2:27 min.)  Web Extra: U.S. Intel Video Cites N.K., Syria Link (11:50 min.)  Bush Administration Opens Up About Israeli Airstrike On Syrian Reactor WASHINGTON (CBS News) â The White House said Thursday that North Korea's secret work on anuclear reactor with Syria was ""a dangerous and potentiallydestabilizing development for the world,"" raising doubts aboutPyongyang's intention to carry through with a promised disclosure ofits nuclear activities.  Sevenmonths after Israel bombed the reactor, the White House broke itssilence and said North Korea assisted Syria's secret nuclear programand that the destroyed facility was not intended for ""peacefulpurposes.""  The disclosure could undermine six-party negotiationsto try to resolve the nuclear standoff with North Korea. The WhiteHouse issued a two-page statement after lawmakers were given detailsabout the reactor in a series of briefings on Capitol Hill. The WhiteHouse said the International Atomic Energy Agency also was beingbriefed on the intelligence.  While calling North Korea's nuclearassistance to Syria a ""dangerous manifestation"" of Pyongyang's nuclearweapons program and its proliferation activities, the U.S. said itremained committed to the talks.  The administration said that after the reactor was damaged beyond repair, Syria tried to bury evidence of its existence.  ""Thiscover-up only served to reinforce our confidence that this reactor wasnot intended for peaceful activities,"" White House press secretary DanaPerino said. ""The Syrian regime must come clean before the worldregarding its illicit nuclear activities.""  CIA Director MichaelHayden, Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell and NationalSecurity Adviser Stephen Hadley briefed lawmakers, who were shown avideo presentation of intelligence information that the administrationcontends establishes a strong link between North Korea's nuclearprogram and the bombed Syrian site. It included still photographs thatshowed a strong resemblance between specific features of the plant andthe one near Yongbyon.  According to officials familiar with thepresentation, it did not show moving images inside the facility or anyNorth Korean workers, but included photographs that depict similaritiesbetween the North Korean and Syrian reactor designs.  U.S.negotiators have been trying hard to close a deal in which North Koreawould admit to and give up all its nuclear activities in return forbeing taken off the list of countries that support terrorism, reportsCBS News national security correspondent David Martin.  But atthe same time, the administration had all the photos showing NorthKorea was secretly helping Syria build a reactor that could produceplutonium for nuclear weapons, adds Martin. The images include a photothat U.S. intelligence says shows the head of Syria's nuclear agencywith one of the North Koreans who was negotiating with the UnitedStates.  By making the photos public, Martin reports, the U.S. istelling North Korea: ""If you won't come clean, we'll come clean foryou.""  The Syrian nuclear reactor destroyed by Israeli jets waswithin weeks or months of being functional, a top U.S. official toldThe Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because of thesensitivity of the matter. The official said the facility was mostlycompleted but still needed significant testing before it could bedeclared operational.  No uranium, which is needed to fuel areactor, was evident at the site, a remote area of eastern Syria alongthe Euphrates River. But the U.S. official said the reactor was similarin design to a North Korean reactor at Yongbyon, which has in the pastproduced small amounts of plutonium, the marterial needed to makepowerful nuclear weapons.  Top members of the House IntelligenceCommittee said the reactor posed a serious threat of spreadingdangerous nuclear materials.  ""This is a serious proliferationissue, both for the Middle East and the countries that may be involvedin Asia,"" said Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich.  Hoekstra andIntelligence Committee Chairman Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, toldreporters after the closed meeting that they were angry that the Bushadministration had delayed briefing the full committee for eight months.  ""It'sbad management and terrible public policy to go for eight monthsknowing this was out there and then drop this in our laps six hoursbefore they go to the public,"" Hoekstra said.  President Bush'sfailure to keep Congress informed has created friction that may imperilcongressional support for Bush's policies toward North Korea and Syria,he said.  ""It totally breaks down any trust that you have betweenthe administration and Congress,"" Hoekstra said. ""I think it reallyjeopardizes any type of the agreement they may come up with"" regardingNorth Korea.  A senior administration said the White House wentpublc with the evidence now to prevent an even broader confrontation inthe Middle East region, reports CBS News White House correspondent MarkKnoller.  ""We feared that if knowledge of this event spread quickly Syria might feel greater pressure to react,"" the official said.  The White House also stressed that North Korea's assistance on the Syrian reactor was an issue of ""great international concern.""  ""Theconstruction of this reactor was a dangerous and potentiallydestabilizing development for the region and the world,"" Perino said inthe statement. ""This is particularly true because it was done covertlyand in violation of the very procedures designed to reassure the worldof the peaceful intent of nuclear activities.  ""The United Statescalls upon the international community to redouble our common effortsto ending these activities and preventing the spread of weapons of massdestruction in this critical region.""",0

"  Didn't know much about hemp, so I looked it up. Seems like we should allow it here!  Hemp (from Old English hÃ¦nep, see cannabis (etymology)) is the common name for plants of the entire family of Cannabis, although the term is often used to refer only to Cannabis strains cultivated for industrial (non-drug) use. Hemp is cultivated virtually everywhere in the world except for the United States, and its cultivation in western countries is growing steadily. For example, Canadian Hempseed exports surged 300% last year[citation needed]. China, and other eastern countries, never prohibited its cultivation and use it extensively.  Industrial hemp has thousands of potential uses, from paper to textiles to biodegradable plastics to health food to fuel but it has not been the great commercial success that the enthusiast hoped for in countries where it is legal to harvest. It is one of the fastest growing biomasses on the planet, and one of the earliest domesticated plants known. It also runs parallel with the ""Green Future"" objectives that are becoming increasingly popular. Hemp requires little to no pesticides, replenishes soil with nutrients and nitrogen, controls erosion of the topsoil, and produces lots of oxygen, considering how fast it grows. Furthermore, Hemp could be used to replace many potentially harmful products, such as tree paper (the process of which uses bleaches and other toxic chemicals, apart from contributing to deforestation), cosmetics (which often contain synthetic oils that can clog pores and provide little nutritional content for the skin), plastics (which are petroleum based and cannot decompose), and more.",0

"  There are exceptions to the 4th Amendment in relation to public schools. Read this:  Public Schools .--In New Jersey v. T.L.O.,  108 the Court set forth the principles governing searches by public school authorities. The Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by public school officials because ''school officials act as representatives of the State, not merely as surrogates for the parents.''  109 However, ''the school setting requires some easing of the restrictions to which searches by public authorities are ordinarily subject.''  110 Neither the warrant requirement nor the probable cause standard is appropriate, the Court ruled. Instead, a simple reasonableness standard governs all searches of students' persons and effects by school authorities.  111 A search must be reasonable at its inception, i.e., there must be ''reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school.''  112 School searches must also be reasonably related in scope to the circumstances justifying the interference, and ''not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.''  113 In applying these rules, the Court upheld as reasonable the search of a student's purse to determine whether the student, accused of violating a school rule by smoking in the lavatory, possessed cigarettes. The search for cigarettes uncovered evidence of drug activity held admissible in a prosecution under the juvenile laws.     Click here for source",0

"Obviously, you have no idea how the mortgage markets worked. What benefit would it be for Joe Lender to hold on to a loan he knows will go bad? Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac acting as intermediaries between the lenders and the overall secondary mortgage market facilitated this entire situation.  The article itself says that 24% of Fannie and Freddie's assets were subprime. Percents are ratios. 84% of the total sub prime loans made is not calculated from the same total number that 24% was derived from.  Do you need proof that Fannie and Freddie buy mortgages and sell them on the secondary market?  Here from Fannie Mae's website, ""Fannie Mae operates in the U.S. secondary mortgage market. Rather than making home loans directly with consumers, we work with mortgage bankers, brokers, and other primary mortgage market partners to help ensure they have funds to lend to home buyers at affordable rates. We fund our mortgage investments primarily by issuing debt securities in the domestic and international capital markets.""  I can't find an actual figure stating how much of these private sector loans were actually sold to Fannie and Freddie. However, citing that Fannie doesn't make direct home loans to consumers they had to buy their sub prime holdings from somewhere. My guess is the private sector since thats where the mortgage bankers, brokers, and other primary mortgage market partners reside.",0

" An Admiral Takes on the White House By Gareth Porter Go to Original Washington - A new article on CENTCOM commander Adm. William Fallonconfirms that his public statements last fall ruling out war againstIran last fall were not coordinated with the White House and landed himin trouble more than once with President George W. Bush and VicePresident Dick Cheney. In anadmiring article on Fallon in Esquire, former Pentagon official ThomasP.M. Barnett writes that Fallon angered the White House by ""brazenlychallenging"" Bush on his aggressive threat of war against Tehran.Barnett also cites ""well-placed observers"" as saying Bush may soonreplace Fallon with a ""more pliable"" commander. Barnett's account, which quotes conversations with Fallon during theCENTCOM commander's trips to the Middle East, shows that Fallonprivately justified his statements contradicting the Bush policy ofkeeping the ""option"" of an unprovoked attack on Iran ""on the table"" asnecessary to calm the fears of Egypt and other friendly Arab regimes ofa US-Iran war. Barnett recalls thatwhen Fallon was in Cairo in November, the lead story in that day'sedition of the English-language daily Egyptian Gazette carried theheadline ""US Rules Out Strike against Iran"" over a picture of Fallonmeeting with President Hosni Mubarak. That story, published Nov. 19 and not picked up by any US news media,reported that Fallon had ""ruled out a possible strike against Iran andsaid Washington was mulling nonmilitary options instead."" Later that day, according to Barnett, Fallon told him during a coffeebreak in a military meeting, ""I'm in hot water again,"" and thenconfirmed that his problems were directly with the White House. That was the second time in less than a week and the third time inseven weeks that Fallon had publicly declared that there would be nowar against Iran. In an interview with Al-Jazeera television inSeptember, which Fallon himself had requested, according to a source atAl-Jazeera, he had said, ""This constant drum beat of conflict is whatstrikes me which is not helpful and not useful."" And only a week before the trip to Egypt, in an interview withFinancial Times, Fallon had said, a military strike was not ""in theoffing,"" adding, ""Another war is just not where we want to go."" These statements represented an extraordinary exercise of power by acombat commander, because it contradicted a central feature of theBush-Cheney strategy on Iran. High-ranking Bush administrationofficials had been routinely repeating the administration's line thatno option had been taken ""off the table"" since early 2005. At an Oct. 17 news conference, Bush said he had ""told people that ifyou're interested in avoiding World War III, it seems like you ought tobe interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary tomake a nuclear weapon."" Fallon'spublic statements explicitly ruling out an attack on Iran thusundermined the Bush administration's threat against Iran. The willingness of the top commander in the Middle East to take themilitary option ""off the table"" was in part a reflection of thedetermination of uniformed military leaders to prevent what theyregarded as a disastrous course. Thenew chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, whoreplaced Gen. Peter Pace in June, was even more candid about hisopposition to the use of force against Iran than Pace had been,according to a Congressional staffer who had participated in privatemeetings with both. Pace declared publicly in late October, ""We have tobe mindful of the risks that would [be spawned] by engaging in a thirdconflict"" in the region. Mullen added, however, that military options ""cannot be taken off the table."" But Fallon, as the commander responsible for the entire Middle East,was concerned about more than the consequences of actually exercisingthe military option. He was prompted to enunciate a ""no-war"" line onIran by the panicky reactions of Arab states to what they thought wereindications of the warlike intentions of Bush administration. In the latter half of 2007 friendly Arab regimes were upset by thepossibility of a US-Iran war, which they feared would destabilize theentire region. Fallon is quoted as telling Barnett, ""[I]t's all anyonewants to talk about right now. People here hear what I'm saying andunderstand. I don't want to get them too spun up."" Fallon told Barnett that his ruling out of military action against Iranwas necessary to calm the very regimes the Bush administration washoping to enlist to support its anti-Iran line. ""Washington interpretsthis as all aimed at them,"" Fallon said in Cairo, according to Barnett.""Instead, it's aimed at governments and media in this region. I'm nottalking about the White House."" Fallon was arguing, in effect, that it makes no sense to make thepossibility of an unprovoked attack part of your declaratory policy ifmerely induces confusion and panic among friendly governments withoutinfluencing the target of the threat. Barnett quotes Fallon as complaining that ""they"" - meaning White Houseofficials - were asking him, ""Why are you even meeting with Mubarak?""But Fallon strongly defended the diplomatic role he was playing inrelations with Mubarak and other Middle Eastern leaders. ""This is mycenter of gravity,"" Fallon told him. ""This is my job."" Fallon's sensitivity to the political-diplomatic consequences of adeclaratory policy that explicitly keeps open the threat of anaggressive war as a potential option set him apart not only from theWhite House but from the consensus among national security specialistsin both parties. In early 2007, all three of the top three Democraticcontenders for the presidential nomination publicly declared theirsupport for keeping ""all options on the table."" Fallon is not the first CENTCOM commander to rein in aggressive WhiteHouse policy toward the Middle East. In late 1997, according to DanaPriest's book, The Mission, the Bill Clinton White House wanted CENTCOMcommander Gen. Anthony Zinni to order his pilots to provoke a militaryconfrontation with Iraq in the no-fly zone by deliberately drawing firefrom Iraqi planes. The request forsuch a provocation was conveyed to Zinni by the vice chairman of theJoint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Ralston. But Zinni, who believed thatit could lead to an unwanted war with Iraq, insisted that a formalrequest from the White House would have to be sent, and the plan wasdropped. The unhappiness of the Bushadministration with Fallon's role as well as the unflattering pictureof administration policy revealed by the article was evident Thursdayfrom the failure of either the White House or the Pentagon to issue theusual reassuring statements in response to the article. The White House declined to comment, although, according to theWashington Post's Thomas Ricks, the article ""was being discussedthere."" The Pentagon spokesman, Geoff Morrell, said Secretary ofDefense Robert M. Gates ""has read the profile on Admiral Fallon butchooses not to comment on it or other press accounts.""",0

  Hayden Christensen was likely THE worst cast for Anakin Sykwalker. I figured either George Lucas either wanted a bargain bin actor or he just couldn't find anyone else to replace him. I remembered after Episode 2 came into theaters it was rumored that Hugh Jackman was to take over the role of Anakin Sykwalker. Reason that was the rumor was because it was said at the time that Episode 3 would take place a big amount of years after Episode 2.  It was right when Episode 3 went into production that everyone around saw that the rumor was false and Hayden was back.I personally liked Episode 3 alot and did appreciate alot of the things in it. I liked the entire beginning with the battle over Coruscant took place which lead to the duel between Anakin and Count Dooku.  I also liked how the emperor held a lightsaber and did combat with Yoda and also the whole battle sequence between General Grievous and Obi Wan was surely entertaining. I liked Episode 3 and it would be entertaining to see The Force Unleashed turned into a film. if it is written well and has a good director on board I would be satisfied.  If The Force Unleashed is turned into a film I would highly doubt George Lucas would direct. He would most likely co write and probably produce. The least Star Wars brand he would direct would be some of the episodes on the upcoming live action TV show due in late 2011.,0

And what we don't know either is how much the cabin crew took from them for any in flight drinks?

"Iraqi PM Gives Basra Gunmen Ultimatum Rocket Attacks Hit Green Zone  By Sholnn Freeman and Sudarsan Raghavan Washington Post Foreign Service Wednesday, March 26, 2008; 11:39 AM    BAGHDAD, March 26 -- Clashes continued Wednesday between Iraqi security forces and Shiite militias in the southern city of Basra, as Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki laid down a deadline for gunmen to surrender and fresh rocket attacks hit Baghdad's Green Zone.  The U.S. Embassy in the Iraqi capital said that three Americans were badly hurt by the latest strikes in the Green Zone, a fortified area that houses the U.S. Embassy compound and the Iraqi government, according to the Associated Press. No further details were immediately available. Mortars and rockets have struck the Green Zone and other U.S. positions repeatedly since Sunday, with U.S. officials reporting 12 strikes Tuesday.  According to wire reports, as many as 55 people have died during the past two days in intense clashes that began in Basra as part of an Iraqi government crackdown on Shiite militias in the area, particularly the Mahdi Army of hard-line cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Violence subsequently spread to Shiite areas in Baghdad and other cities.  The operation in Basra won praise Tuesday from the White House, where spokeswoman Dana Perino referred to it as a ""brave decision"" by Maliki to assert Iraqi government control over an important port city that serves as the country's gateway to the Persian Gulf.  According to wire service reports, Maliki issued a statement giving gunmen in Basra three days to give up their weapons and renounce further violence. Those who don't, said a Maliki aide, will be targeted for arrest in the ongoing security operation.  Speaking about the Basra offensive, U.S. military spokesman Maj. Gen. Kevin Bergner said, ""Initial reports are that they are making progress."" But he cautioned that it was still too early to grade the success of the operation.  ""A large part of the determination will be the citizens of Basra and how they respond,"" Bergner said at a briefing Wednesday in the Green Zone. He said Iraq has moved an additional 2,000 troops to Basra. A British military spokesman said Tuesday that Iraqi police and military troops in the area total 16,700, including national policemen, special forces and military police.  Bergner called the rocket attacks against the Green Zone ""criminal activity"" and said U.S. weapons teams had stopped eight intended rocket attacks targeting the Green Zone and located a stockpile of the weapons.  Iraqi forces were backed by U.S. and British reconnaissance planes as they launched their Basra offensive, an operation aimed at breaking the power of politically backed gunmen in the city.  The fiercest fighting took place in Basra neighborhoods where Iraqi forces targeted members of Sadr's Mahdi Army, further risking the collapse of a cease-fire that Sadr declared last summer. His fighters' stand-down has been widely credited with helping curb violence throughout the country during the U.S. troop buildup known as the surge.  When the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus, and Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker deliver a report card on the country before Congress next month, a key gauge of progress will be whether the Iraqi government and its security forces are prepared to take over as U.S. troops withdraw.  The offensive in Basra, an important test of that preparedness, was several weeks in the making. Altough it targets the Mahdi Army in particular, its goal is also to break the grip that other Shiite militias, criminal gangs and death squads hold upon the southern port city, the conduit for Iraq's oil exports. In recent weeks, the militias have often battled one another in the streets.  It was unclear why U.S. forces would take part in a broad armed challenge to Sadr and his thousands-strong militia on the eve of Petraeus's assessment, which the Bush administration has said would greatly influence its decision on whether to draw down troop levels.  But many Sadr followers view the offensive as the latest attempt by the United States and Sadr's Shiite rivals, who run Iraq's government, to take advantage of Sadr's cease-fire to weaken his movement politically ahead of provincial elections that could take place this year.  ""We are really scared,"" said Aahad Hamid, 27, a Basra University employee whose voice quivered on the phone as Iraqi attack helicopters flew over the city. ""We can hear the voice of the bullets.""  In a sign of the offensive's importance, Maliki flew to Basra on Monday to oversee operations.  By Tuesday evening, Iraqi security forces and Shiite militias had also clashed in the cities of Kut and Hilla, as well as outside Sadr's Baghdad stronghold of Sadr City. Dusk-to-dawn curfews were imposed on at least six cities in southern Iraq, police said.  In addition to resisting with arms, Sadr's movement led a labor strike for a second day in many parts of eastern and central Baghdad on Tuesday, demanding the release of Sadr's jailed followers and an end to Iraqi government raids. Sadrist leaders ordered stores to close and taxi and bus drivers to stop operations. Many neighborhoods turned into virtual ghost towns, their usually busy streets all but empty. Parents kept their children home from school.  Sadr, who imposed the cease-fire to improve his nationalist credentials and rein in his often unruly militia, is under immense pressure from senior loyalists to lift the cease-fire order. Two weeks ago, he issued a statement permitting the Mahdi Army to fire on U.S. and Iraqi forces in self-defense. Hazim al-Araji, a senior Sadr official in the southern holy city of Najaf, told reporters there that the cease-fire remains in place despite Tuesday's clashes.  Later, hundreds of Sadr followers took to the streets of Najaf, carrying Korans, Iraqi flags and olive branches. Calling Maliki ""the agent of Americans,"" they chanted: ""No, no occupation! No, no terrorism!""  ""The Iraqi army went to Basra under the pretext of imposing a security plan, but the fact is they are targeting Sadrists,"" said Haidar al-Jaberi, a Sadr official who joined the protest.  Violence has gripped Basra since December, when British troops handed over control of the province to the Iraqi government. A power struggle between the Mahdi Army and its main rival, the Badr Organization militia of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, has battered the city in recent months. Smaller Shiite militias are also taking part in the fighting.  Ahead of the offensive, the Iraqi government closed off land access to the city and imposed a nighttime curfew until further notice. The government ordered schools, institutes and universities to cancel classes from Tuesday through Thursday. Some residents said they had no time to stock up on food and clean water.  Residents also reported that sporadic clashes began in Basra early Tuesday morning in the neighborhoods of Hayania, Jubaila and Jumhuria, all known Sadr strongholds. In telephone interviews, they described seeing military vehicles, soldiers and policemen exchanging fire with gunmen. Television footage showed militiamen firing rocket-propelled grenades at Iraqi security forces; others attacked from rooftops with AK-47 assault rifles, machine guns and mortars.  As of Tuesday afternoon, 13 gunmen, three Iraqi policemen and six civilians had been killed, police said. Scores more were injured, and at least five military vehicles were set ablaze, according to police.  ""No one is on the street,"" said Mohammed Kadhim, who owns a clothing shop in the city center. As he spoke, gunfire could be heard in the background. ""I am not able to go out of my house.""  Kadhim added that one of his neighbors had been shot in the face and was in critical condition.  A total of 15,000 Iraqi military and police personnel were participating in the Basra operation, according to an adviser to Iraq's security forces who spoke by telephone. At one point in the conversation, a mortar shell landed near his building, he said. He paused to take time to check on his soldiers and examine his body for shrapnel.  ""It's a tough and difficult battle,"" he said, adding that his men were fighting Mahdi Army militias, criminal gangs and death squads.  The adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters, said he expected the campaign to take a week to 10 days. ""No state can have two armies. It is either the Iraqi military or the Mahdi Army,"" he said.  Col. Bill Buckner, a U.S. military spokesman, said coalition forces were providing intelligence, surveillance and support aircraft. Maj. Tom Holloway, a British military spokesman, said British forces were standing by but were not involved in the crackdown. He also said the British and Americans were providing surveillance support from aircraft.  As the offensive progressed, violence broke out elsewhere in the country. In Baghdad's al-Amin neighborhood, Mahdi Army gunmen stormed two offices of the Dawa party, which Maliki heads, and clashed with guards there. Five Mahdi Army gunmen and two Dawa guards were killed, an Interior Ministry official said.  In Sadr City on Tuesday afternoon, Mahdi Army militiamen were manning checkpoints and directing traffic. The main police station was empty.  Abu Ali al-Fartousi, a Mahdi Army fighter, said a battle broke out in Sadr City at 10:30 p.m., with Mahdi fighters using machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades to repel government forces. A U.S. military spokesman reported no word on any late-night fighting in Sadr City.  Lt. Col. Steven Stover, a U.S. military spokesman, said U.S. troops backed Iraqi security forces as they engaged with ""special groups criminal elements outside of Sadr City."" A U.S. soldier was killed about 5 p.m. in an attack near Baghdad's Adhamiyah district, the U.S. military said. He was not identified.  Special correspondents Zaid Sabah, Naseer Nouri, Dalya Hassan and K.I. Ibrahim in Baghdad, Saad Sarhan in Najaf, and Washington Post staff in Nasiriyah contributed to this report.

social heathcare will fail in this country it hasnt worked anywhere else it wont work here.  i belive we need to make healthcare a little cheaper to a certain degree. we shouldnt just give it away like to do food stamps. the more u give stuff away like that the higher prices go up so you still cant get it. its like when he said if u just tax the corps. they just go up on prices what we need to do is not tax anyone more but to stop all the loop holes in the system. you can raise the tax all you want on the rich they will just find a way out of it.  oh and on you stupid comment about 250K being rich yeah like 30 years ago. my Father makes 140k alone that doesnt include all th bonouses he gets through out the year and the investments he has made and yet he is still struggling a little not alot but he odesnt have a maid or personal driver in fact he dives a 1997 dondge intrepid that needs new brakes and belts. yes he does things with my mom time to time but they work thier ass off to save money for trips. we went from being in a trailer trach area to living in a nicer town. its not 90210 but its safer and better then what we had before and its cuz he worked his ass off and still does.  Sure thier are those who do work hard that need help but thier are just as many in the lower class that dont do anything that expect the govermnt to take care of them and its bull. go watch and see people get food stamps and watch the poeple who pull up in escallades with 22's go get some. its bull so whats going to happen is now my dad and mom are going to have to pay more taxes of rthem to get more free stuff from the gov.,0

At any rate, the chances of Palin stepping into the position some time in the next 4 years is significant.  That having been said, this is the woman who flatly stated that the VPOTUS runs the Senate, and can really get in there and mix it up and change things with the senators.  *shudder*",0

"Michele Bachmann's rival reaps benefits of her 'Hardball' comments LA Times, 10/23/08  By P.J. Huffstutter  Reporting from Blaine, Minn. â Elwyn Tinklenberg is living the long-shot candidate's political dream.  There weren't enough chairs for the volunteers crammed inside the four-room campaign office Wednesday morning. Every time aides hit ""refresh"" on their computers, hundreds more online donations appeared. Downstairs, the postal carrier spent 10 minutes trying to cram a two-foot stack of envelopes stuffed with checks into the mail slot.  ""It's been raining money,"" said Beth DeZiel, 39, the campaign's dazed deputy finance director. ""There's so much, we can barely keep up. It's unbelievable.""  But this unsolicited good fortune -- $1.3 million since Friday -- isn't based on anything the Democratic former mayor and grandfather of seven did. It's all because of something his rival, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, said.  On Friday afternoon, Bachmann appeared on MSNBC's ""Hardball with Chris Matthews"" and made what has been dubbed the million-dollar mistake: Bachmann, 52, alleged that presidential candidate Barack Obama may hold ""anti-American"" views, and proposed a media investigation into ""the views of the people in Congress [to] find out: Are they pro-America or anti-America?""  While Sen. Obama's presidential bid has transformed the way campaigns use the Internet to reach volunteers and donors, the technology has also become a way for the public to instantly react -- even to races in which they can't vote.  Those quick reactions, often in the form of donations, can influence the outcome of a campaign, said Julie Barko Germany, director of the Institute for Politics, Democracy & the Internet at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.  Barko German said ""the Internet can be an amplifier,"" enabling viewers to react instantly to something that incites strong support or fury.  ""It's an excellent fundraising tool,"" she added, citing research indicating that ""when you show someone a video online, they donate 10% more.""  Bachmann's interview has turned the race into one of the country's most intensely watched. It also unleashed an online backlash against Bachmann, who many local political observers assumed would easily win reelection.  President Bush won the district in 2004 with 57% of the vote. In 2006, former state Sen. Bachmann was heralded as the first female Republican to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from the district, which is dominated by blue-collar and farming communities.  And this summer, one of the few polls conducted in the race showed that Bachmann held a 13-point lead over Tinklenberg.  But on Wednesday, the National Republican Congressional Committee pulled all of its TV advertising supporting Bachmann in the 6th District, according to a GOP source. Since her ""Hardball"" appearance, Bachmann's lawn signs have been vandalized. Callers spew profanity at volunteers and obscenities about the congresswoman at her district campaign office.  Bachmann has retreated from her statements at nearly every campaign stop. She blamed the brouhaha on falling into a ""trap"" she said Matthews laid for her, and on having her words twisted by bloggers.  ""This has been a game of telephone gone into overdrive -- nothing more,"" said Bachmann spokeswoman Michelle Marston. ""A week ago, our competitor had no name identification. If they think that they'll win by throwing a million dollars worth of mud, I can tell you right now it won't be enough.""  Marston said Bachmann's campaign also had seen a jump in contributions, from sympathetic donors who feel she's being unfairly targeted. But Marston said she didn't know the specific amount.  At the time Bachmann was on ""Hardball,"" Tinklenberg was watching a college hockey game and stumping for votes in the bleachers. The cheers drowned out the sound of his cellphone ringing.  ""By the time I looked at it, my voice mail was full,"" said Tinklenberg, 58, who served as Gov. Jesse Ventura's transportation commissioner from 1999 to 2002 and now works as a transportation consultant.  ""It was family, friends, neighbors, supporters,"" Tinklenberg said. ""Everyone was asking, 'Did you see what she said?' ""  Since then, the campaign -- whose eight staff members had gone Dumpster-diving for office furniture and the wire wickets used for lawn signs -- has become flush.  The majority of the funds have come electronically. Of the more than 20,000 online donations, 3,210 came from Minnesota. An additional 2,405 people donated from California, and 2,330 from Texas.  Thousands of people have called the campaign office, offering up their credit card numbers. Some gave the maximum $2,300, but most offered far smaller amounts, $3 or $5, along with a message of support and an apology for not being able to give more.  ""I'm a registered Republican and I have never made contributions to political campaigns,"" wrote one 66-year-old donor. ""I wish I could send more."" In a greeting card with a fuzzy white kitten on the front, another donor wrote, ""What your opponent said on Chris Matthews was sickening! Hope you can defeat her!""  People who said they couldn't afford to give cash have been dropping off food for Tinklenberg and the staff -- platters of apple strudel, pots of chicken noodle soup, paper bags stuffed with oatmeal cookies.  Now, Tinklenberg said, the campaign is trying to find ways to spend so much money in so little time, so he can get out his message on ways to attract jobs, improve public infrastructure and expand public transportation options. His staff is frantically contacting local TV and radio stations to snap up available advertisement spots, installing more phone lines and placing orders for stacks of boxes of campaign literature.  ""I'm not happy she said what she said,"" Tinklenberg said. ""But we certainly are benefiting from it.""  Huffstutter is a Times staff writer.  ------------------------------------------     Here is the Anti-American Tinklenberg's website where you can give til' it hurts.   HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!   If Tinklenberg wins, I will be gloating for years.",0

"This isn't even debatable anymore. The ARMED FORCES JOURNAL (the bunch of pansy, pacifist liberals that they are) argued that waterboarding = torture some time ago.  http://www.armedforcesjournal.com/2007/12/3230108  TO RUDY GIULIANI AND ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE MICHAEL MUKASEY For their tacit support of waterboarding. In an interview, Giuliani was asked for his views on using Ã¢â¬Åenhanced interrogation techniques,Ã¢â¬ including waterboarding. He responded that in a hypothetical scenario that assumed an attack, Ã¢â¬ÅI would tell the people who had to do the interrogation to use every method they can think of.Ã¢â¬ Prompted again on the specific use of waterboarding, he repeated Ã¢â¬Åevery method they could think of.Ã¢â¬ Mukasey said he found waterboarding to be Ã¢â¬Årepugnant,Ã¢â¬ but he wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t answer whether it amounted to torture.  Let AFJ be crystal clear on a subject where these men are opaque: Waterboarding is a torture technique that has its history rooted in the Spanish Inquisition. In 1947, the U.S. prosecuted a Japanese military officer for carrying out a form of waterboarding on a U.S. civilian during World War II.  Waterboarding inflicts on its victims the terror of imminent death. And as with all torture techniques, it is, therefore, an inherently flawed method for gaining reliable information. In short, it doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t work. That blunt truth means all U.S. leaders, present and future, should be clear on the issue.",0

"   Oh, from the outside looking in, you're right.  But from inside the McCain campaign ... the notion that a candidate runs with a verity that he may die due to his age and health in office isn't in the playbook. So it is McCain first, Palin second and only in a supporting role.  Palin stealing headlines from Obama is one thing but also pushing McCain off the headlines is not acceptable.  It was important to get the base back with him because his position with them hasn't always been a totally warm and fuzzy experience. Palin was the answer, it seems. The question really is, though, how big is that base today compared to previous elections?  Vocal, the base may be but how many are still in that base? I have my doubts that it is as big as it once was. It is still sizable and McCain needs them to have a prayer of chance of winning but I am a little skeptical about its current size partly because of Palin and what her stronpoints at re-activating that base happen to be.",0

To answer the question... based on the map posted in the thread it's obvious the southeast is not receiving the same percentage of taxes. I'm guessing that the southeast financially speaking is wealthier than the northern parts. It is fashionable for wealthy people to donate to charities. It is possible that whatever taxes they have less of in comparison with the other parts are compensated for by people donated to various charities such as privately funded soup kitchens and other things of that nature. Now in saying all that I said I was not implying that all public services are necessarily necessary and in writing what was just written previously in this sentence I was not saying whether or not I disagree with various public services being funded.,0

"  Well in that case we could just cut one down......even when we need one there still hated. when you think of a lawyer the first thing that always comes to mind is your going to get screwed.  Funny that your bro is a real estate attorney. In my one post about getting screwed over by the one I retained, dealed exclusivly with real estate law. The deception he used to justify his costs was unbelievable, using most of the retainer in phone calls to me ""reviewing the facts"" over and over again. That scumbag even billed me for creating a bill. By the time he actually contacted the developer most of the retainer was gone and of course he needed more money to continue.  There's some things that most decent people don't do, however seems normal for lawyers to cross that line. There in the same class as a funeral director, acting like they feel for your pain and loss, then turn around and sell you a 1,000 casket for 10 grand, of course at the same time selling you a bill of goods that how your departed would be better respected in the silk lined box with the gold plated hardware.",0

"Fallon 'may lose job over Iran war'  Adm.William Fallon, the head of the US Central Command, may lose his jobfor opposing President Bush's plans to wage war against Iran. According to a new Esquirearticle by Thomas Barnett; Admiral Fallon may be prematurely 'relievedof his command' as soon as this summer to be replaced with a more'pliable' commander.  ""If that were to happen, it maywell mean that the president and vice-president intend to take militaryaction against Iran before the end of this year and don't want acommander standing in their way,"" says the article which will bepublished on March 12.  Admiral Fallon, who has beennamed as 'one of the best strategic thinkers in uniform today' byDefense Secretary Robert Gates, opposed the troops surge in Iraq andhas consistently battled with President George W. Bush to avertconfrontation with Iran.  The Navy admiral has vowed thatan attack on Iran would 'not happen on his watch', calling the WhiteHouse warmongering echelons 'not helpful'.  Washington and its allies are at loggerheads with the Islamic Republic over the country's nuclear standoff with the West.  TheBush administration accuses Iran of pursuing nuclear weaponry, whileTehran maintains its uranium enrichment will only provide fuel for thecountry's under-construction nuclear power plants.  PresidentBush insists the military option against Iran remains on the table,while his top military experts, including Admiral Fallon, urge theWhite House to choose a diplomatic approach towards Tehran.  In a Thursday White House press briefing, spokeswoman Dana Perino was asked about the Esquire piece and refused to confirm whether Fallon's position is secure until the end of his tenure.",0

"It is possible that Palin's strengths as a personality were not capitalized properly by the McCain campaign. Her expensive makeover, for example, might not have been so radically necessary if the idea were to push the hockey mom image more.  But I think there are some pretty obvious reasons why the campaign wants to control Palin rather tightly. Upon introduction of Palin, the talk was as if Obama and Palin were the ones directly contesting for office.  This obviously would be damaging to McCain so you would have to think that McCain's advisers would want to redirect the focus on the main candidate and, also, bring Palin under wing in terms of talking points ... the way that the McCain advisers see the issues to be.  Rollins refers to the problem as mishandling Palin which does not underscore whether he saw Palin as an asset for substantive issues.  Bill Kristol, an early and still vocal champion of Palin feels that she should have been let loose to just speak her mind ... within bounds, presumably.  Either way, her role was to keep the hopes of a major BOP base alive and active and she has done that.  That there are GOP opinion leaders that have moved away from the campaign to support Obama isn't simply a matter of Palin having been mishandled, imo.",0

"  K. Now here is my stance on it all. I think if 1 is legal the other has to be. Simply because they are the same thing in concept: cheap labor for an advantage in a market, less input for the same output. I'm not necessarily for both, but i do think that if Companies can go offshore, then companies who can't afford to (Despite the industry) should be able to higher cheap labor.  The problem with socialism is that government controlling wages will lead to lack of effort because of the lack of benefits. Right now, people work hard and continue to work hard to work their way up that ladder, with socialism, you don't get the same kind of purpose, or drive, from the workers. What we have now, isn't a real capitalism because no matter what, the gov't still watches for monopolies and still regulates a base point in wages (minimum wages).  I would prefer a capitalistic market over a socialistic market any day of the week because it benefits the hard working man who strives to climb the ladder.",0

"Bale's Batman voice was shit. (and that concludes the list of things not awesome about ""The Dark Knight"")  The movie is badass. Best (non indie) of the Year. (mainstream NEVER tops indie)  And now, Corrections to dumb comments made earlier by people who just didn't know any better:  1) ""The Dark Knight"" is a gift from god... Specifically to me. 2) Ledger's ""Joker"" is in fact the greatest portrayl of a (super)villain of all times. Primarily due to the fact that He played it in such a realistic way. If a super villain like ""The Joker"" did really exist, I imagine that he'd be exactly like that. Most super villains in movies don't have the level of realistic character depth, that Ledger, (along with the amazing writers) brought to the ""joker"".ÃÂ  Besides... I dare the OP to suggest who IS the greatest villain then, since ""the joker isn't"" 3)I agree that other films have been storywise on par (and better) than The Dark Knight... But what makes this one stand out is that it was done on a mainstream scale.ÃÂ  This movie is VERY noir, and dark, unhappy movies are generally not so big with the mass public.ÃÂ  Thats why we've rarely seen it done (if ever), in a guaranteed blockbuster hit like a Batman movie (or any other big name superhero movie)ÃÂ  I think with the success of ""The Dark Knight"" big budget studios may stop ""playing it safe"" and start producing more films that think outside ""hollywood box"".  -Dark Knight was awesome.ÃÂ  Very Awesome.",0

"  A bit late in the day but you're right, you will get flayed for this.  This is the argument that Kelvin McKenzie tried to use when doing a bit of Jock bashing on quesiton time.  However, the true figures that came about later showed that out of the UK Scotland was the only part that received what it gave, ie we are self sufficient, if you include the revenues from Scottish gas and oil which at present has been subsidising the rest of the UK since the 70s.  Scotland says it pays its way and does not need English taxes Â· Analysis assigns all North Sea revenues to Edinburgh Â· Spendthrift claims based on 'myths and mistakes'  James Meikle The Guardian, Saturday November 3 2007 Article history Scotland pays its own way despite its depiction as a spendthrift nation abusing the generosity of English taxpayers, according to a new analysis of government spending. And far from receiving an unfair proportion of the tax pot, the breakdown shows that Scotland gets less public spending per head than Northern Ireland or London. Tax revenues from Scotland almost match the country's Â£49.2bn a year public spending - although only if all North Sea oil and gas revenues are attributed to Edinburgh, a controversial allocation.  The research, published yesterday by the Glasgow Herald, is based on Treasury figures in Whitehall, an analysis by consultants Oxford Economics and the newspaper's own calculations.  Tired of the clamour from English politicians and the London-based media for Gordon Brown to rein in the Scottish executive's spending, the paper said much of the ""mischief"" was based on a series of myths, mistakes and misconceptions.  David Cameron has signalled that he would review the Treasury system for sharing government funds across the country, adding that people should not think ""there was some magic pot of gold"" in England. Former Sun editor Kelvin Mackenzie also attacked ""our tartan chums"" for taking the ""clever wealth-creators"" of England for granted.  Critics say that Scots receive Â£1,500 a head more than people living in England, but the new analysis suggests the truth is more complicated. Despite its pockets of deprivation - one-third of the UK's landmass and far-flung communities are in Scotland - the average Â£9,631 public spending per head is less than London's Â£9,748 or Northern Ireland's Â£10,271. While cities such as Glasgow receive high levels of incapacity benefit, the overall welfare bill per head, Â£3,086, is lower in Scotland than in large parts of northern England.  The tax take from Scotland is only outranked by London, illustrating how Scots and their businesses are making their contribution to UK coffers, the report said. Not only did the North Sea bonanza swell Britain's public purse, but the nation's heavy smokers, though banned from smoking in public places before the rest of Britain, swelled the tobacco duty contributions disproportionately, contributing more than Â£1bn a year out of a UK Â£8bn.  Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister, said: ""This destroys the myth that Scotland is anything other than a resource-rich nation, well capable of flourishing with independence. Of course, the myth of the subsidised Scot has been peddled not just by Westminster Tories and the English tabloids , but also by politicians in Scotland for their own partisan ends.""  The Herald's senior commentator, Alf Young, said the picture was far more nuanced than the black and white certainties of London-based tabloids. ""Scotland is not some subsidy-obsessed outrider of the British state, offering little in return by way of tax revenues. There are other parts of the UK which receive higher per capita allocations of public expenditure.""",0

"well from your article  ""Fannie, the Federal National Mortgage Association, and Freddie, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., don't lend money, to minorities or anyone else, however. They purchase loans from the private lenders who actually underwrite the loans.""  -like I've been saying.  combine that with:  ""Fannie and Freddie went from holding a high of 48 percent of the subprime loans that were sold into the secondary market to holding about 24 percent""  -which i earlier explained is a huge amount of risky debt to hold. Especially if you're bundling all these mortgages together and selling them off as bonds. Fannie and Freddie were whats known as GSE's (government sponsored enterprise). A problem with GSE's is that many investors like AIG, Lehman Brothers, China, banks, etc. view debt issued by GSE's as risk free because they think the government wont allow the debt to default. Essentially, GSE debt ended up being viewed as Treasury debt with higher return and the same risk. Turns out that wasn't the case now all this debt issued by GSE's has questionable value and its making everything go to shit.  In the end it looks like your article was written by somebody who doesn't know how this whole system works.",0

" Crap! That's scary!  Tens of Thousands Affected In 1996, Aslin requested his files (to which he was entitled under the Public Information Act) and learned for the first time how the authorities had justified the forced sterilizations. ""They termed us feeble-minded idiots, and wrote that our children would be like us or even worse,"" he declares. He was so infuriated at the insult that he filed suit against the state of Michigan, seeking compensation. His claim was turned down last March because the statute of limitations had expired. But Aslin intends to fight on. If a higher court accepts his appeal, the consequences could be far-reaching. For Fred Aslin and his siblings were not an isolated case.  From 1907 onward, at least 60,000 Americans were sterilized against their will. The legal basis for these forced sterilizations was provided by so-called eugenics laws. Most compulsory sterilizations occurred in the 1930s and '40s, but some states, such as Virginia, continued the practice until the late 1970s. Most of the victims were poor and members of minorities, and none of them received compensation, according to Paul Lombardo, professor of law and bioethics at the University of Virginia. A Strong Eugenics Movement in the USA It is not widely known that there was a strong eugenics movement not only in Germany, but in the USA as well. The doctrine, hatched in the second half of the 19th century, combined elements of social Darwinism with the Mendelian theory of heredity. Its advocates pushed for perfecting the human ""gene pool"" by influencing the reproductive process. Their ongoing attempts at achieving a ""perfect"" society included aggressive - and in the case of the Nazis, murderous - actions against marginal groups and minorities.  American scientists played a vanguard role in the eugenics movement, which also had its supporters in Scandinavia, Latin America and Japan. U.S. biologists like Charles B. Davenport and Harry H. Laughlin advocated keeping the ""Anglo-American race"" pure. Their premise was that most ailments, as well as such social problems as poverty and criminality, were hereditary in nature. Therefore persons with a ""good genetic makeup"" should be encouraged to have families, while ""inferior"" people of allegedly poor genetic stock should be prevented from reproducing. Among those people regarded as inferior were epileptics, manic-depressives, prostitutes, alcoholics, the homeless and criminals. Under the eugenics laws, people who came to the negative attention of the social authorities could be branded as ""feeble-minded"" by court order and legally forced to undergo steriliziation. A Model for the Nazis By the early 1930s, some 30 American states had adopted eugenics laws. Most of them were modeled after the law which Harry H. Laughlin had drafted for the state of Virginia in 1924. That legislation found emulators outside the United States too. For example, it served Germany's National Socialists as a model for their 1933 ""Law for Protection Against Genetically Defective Offspring,"" on the basis of which at least 400,000 men and women were forcibly sterilized. More than 200,000 handicapped or allegedly handicapped people were also murdered by the Nazis. The University of Heidelberg was apparently so grateful to eugenicist Laughlin that it awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1936 for his ""services on behalf of racial hygiene.""  In 1927, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of Virginia's sterilization law. This was followed by a swift rise in the number of forced sterilizations in the United States. American eugenicists also pushed for anti-immigration measures and stricter laws to prevent racially mixed marriages. In a speech to the U.S. Congress, Laughlin had argued that ""morally and intellectually inferior"" immigrants from eastern and southern Europe were polluting America's genetic potential. The 1924 Immigration Restriction Act reduced by two thirds the immigration quotas for people from those parts of Europe. In signing the new law, President Calvin Coolidge said: ""America must remain American."" Pseudo-Science at Universities For a time, the doctrine of eugenics exerted considerable influence on American society. Based largely on political and social prejudices, the pseudo-science was taught at schools and universities. Leading institutions, such as Harvard, Cornell and Columbia, offered courses in eugenics. Prominent industrialists like cornflakes magnate J. H. Kellogg supported the creation of eugenics groups and organizations. So-called fitter family contests were held at country fairs, with citizens parading their ""good genes."" Movies like ""The Black Stork"" propagated eugenic sterilization.  During the 1940s, however, the theory of eugenics came under increasing criticism because of its racial prejudices and its lack of scientific foundation. Most American sterilization laws were abandoned during the 1950s. In 1980, former psychiatric patients who had been forced into sterilization banded together for a class-action suit, demanding compensation from the state of Virginia. But a federal judge rejected their suit on the grounds that the U.S. Supreme Court had affirmed the constitutionality of sterilization back in 1927. That Supreme Court ruling was never fought, even in subsequent years. As a result, future damage claims have little prospect of success. And the victims of eugenic forced sterilization have no lobbying power to achieve out-of-court settlements.  Two current exhibits are attempting to shed light on this repressed chapter of American history. The Jewish Federation of Los Angeles, in cooperation with the Goethe Institute, is showing an exhibition of photographs and documents titled ""Polluting the Pure."" And the Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, a genetics research institute in the state of New York, is featuring an online exhibit on the history of the American eugenics movement.* Between 1910 and 1940, the venerable Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory on Long Island housed the Eugenics Record Office, the central research facility of the American eugenics movement. Most of the exhibit's 1,200 documents come from its archives.  * http://vector.cshl.org/eugenics/",0

"hmm,   i can appreciate what your both saying esp if you have benefitted from his decisions   i think london is better now than it was before him, lookin back london was a grimey place not long ago, it still has its problems but there are a lot more good points than there a few years ago  but this is whatÂ i think about ken, he is essentially a gambler, a lot of the projects he has launched are with borrowed money, that means that the project needs to pay for itself or WE get the bill, you wont get this bill through the mail, everything else will slowly get more expensive,   my personal opinion is that ken hasnt opened THAT many doors for londoners, just a few more for the those who can afford it,  ive worked in a lot of places with a whole range of people andÂ ive worked with some reprobates, people so thick its painful to look at them at times  i can only assume that its notÂ that hard to find work, it just depends on how badly u want the work or what your pride will allow you to do,  i wouldnt vote for him just cos i worked for him directly or indirectly, job is a job is a job, u could just as easily get work for a construction or media company with a conservative on the board of directors   my point is tho, i dont know if kens gambles will pay off,Â i hope so, but ultimately it is out of our hands and time will tell,  if tony blair and his lot are anything to go by, we could be in trouble   boris is funny at times, and i think his bufoonery is exagerated as he is reported to have a good business record, but i dont trust the tories,    going on personalities i think ken has had his turn, a lot of blind eyes have been turned and he will get caught soon doing something that could effect our reputation,  boris is a mug ken is a c*nt the liberal dude is a gay copper  turd sandwich or giant douche anyone?     if he runs i might vote greg dyke who has a fantastic surname, good record, stood up to the gov when he needed to and suffered as a consequence but it showed he has some balls, he is from london, lives in london and isnt affliated to any of the partys",0

"It's the ""Oh Shit!"" Moment on Iran  by  Dave Lindorff | March 12, 2008 - 8:18am  Everyhorrormovie has that ""Oh Shit!"" moment, when the hero or heroes arehuddled insome creepy hideout, and suddenly something happens thattells you thatthe monster is just around the corner, or just about toattack. In""Jurassic Park"" it was the pulsing ripples in a cup ofwater, heraldingthe arrival of a T-Rex. In ""Jaws"" it was the deep bassmusic, lettingyou know that a monstrous shark was about to attack. Well,we justgot our ""Oh Shit!"" moment with the just-announced resignationof AdmiralWilliam J. Fallon, the military commander of US Middle Eastoperations. Adm.Fallon, 63, famously said that an attack onIran would not happen ""on mywatch,"" and is widely believed to havealready threatened, along with anumber of other top generals andadmirals, to quit the service if theBush administration were to launchan air attack on Iran. Put thepieces together. We know that thevice president is obsessed with adesire to attack Iran, and has beensince before he even took office.Bush has repeatedly stressed thatIran cannot be permitted to continuewith its nuclear processing (hecalls it their ""nukular"" bomb program,though there is no evidence thatthe country has a nuclear bombdevelopment program, and in fact thelast National Intelligence Estimateon Iran said there was not andhadn't been since 2003). And Fallon hasnow quit. The Eisenhowernuclear aircraft carrier strike forcehas departed for stationing offIran, joining forces already in placethere, and loaded to the brimwith strike aircraft, Tomahawk missiles,and even nuclear weapons. Itwas long ago reported that stealth bombershad been put in place income of the countries of the old Soviet Unionnorth of Iran, as well ason the island of Diego Garcia in the IndianOcean. All theelements, that is to say, are in place for amassive air assault onIranian targets, designed to destroy its nuclearprogram, cripple itsmilitary command and control, and--at least this isa stated Cheneygoal--to lead to the overthrow of the Iranian governmentby its ownpeople. It is, of course, the strategy of madmen. TheUShas no forces to send into Iran. All they can do is bomb it.Andbombing a country doesn't lead its people to rise up. It leads themtorally 'round the flag. Especially when the civilian casualties ofournot-so-""smart"" bombs start to soar. If such an attack weretohappen, we can kiss goodbye to six years of domestic peace, suchaswe've had. The Iranians have considerable capability to inflictdamageon US targets of interest, both overseas and here in the domesticUSusing assymetrical warfare techniques. The worse part is, they'dbecompletely justified in doing so, since any attack on them would beacrime against peace--the gravest of all international crimes. Americantroopsalready mired and pinned down in a war in Iraq, would findthemselvessuddenly under attack by Shia forces there, who for severalyears nowhave been largely leaving them alone. And oil, whichjust bumpedup against $110 a barrel, an all-time record, will doublein priceovernight, as the whole Persian Gulf becomes a war zone. Wecanexpect massive launches of small boats armed with missilesandtorpedoes, as well as sophisticated anti-ship missiles fromshorebatteries, all fired at US ships in the Gulf, and it wouldbeastounding if some or even many vessels of the US fleet weren't sunk. Meanwhile,tankertraffic in the Gulf, which accounts for 20% or more of theworld's oil,will cease as insurance rates for those vessels goesthrough the roof. Themonster of war will be unleashed, and willnot easily be defeated.That's why Adm. Fallon was so opposed to thewhole idea. He knows thatit will be a disaster for the US militarily,economically andpolitically. The worst part is that Cheneyknows this, too. Hejust doesn't care. This is the man's parting shotas he leavesoffice--to put the country into the throes of a war sovicious that noone will think of pursuing him for his long list ofcrimes against thenation and the Constitution. He isguessing--and he may beright--that the American public will,sheep-like as always, rally to thecause, with a new round of yellowmagnet ""ribbons"" on their cars. He ishoping--and he may be right--thatwar will be a boon for the candidacyof Republican John McCain and forembattled Republicans running forCongress. It's a kind of political Hail Mary.  Source",0

WOW cuz its so important to know about that.  I say 1 time put both in a room with normal people to ask questions and lets see what happens.  thats all i really mad at everything else is fun to watch, hell even snl got a laugh out of me on the palin look a like.",0

"Ok, I read the whole article. The most I saw was that as of 2006 Fannie and Freddie had gone from holding 56% to 24% of subprime loans. Thats a reduction yes, but in portfolio terms that is still a HUGE amount weighted toward a risky asset.  The bundled mortgage securities that fannie and freddie offer were seen as minimal risk investments and the fact that 24% of there holdings were in the subprime market sounds downright ludicrous to me.  However, maybe i missed something in the article saying that they only held a small percentage of these loans. can you point me to it?",0

"BUMP FOR UPDATE As I suspected, the ""Hillary raised $10 million online overnight"" report that the Washington Post ran with earlier today was too good to be true. I don't know if the mistake is the reporter's or if someone at Camp Hillary was spinning a bit too fast, but there's no way they raised that much since her win in Pennsylvania yesterday.  An email from Terry McAuliffe, Clinton campaign chairman, that I received three hours ago, says ""More than 50,000 people have contributed to the campaign for the very first time in the last 24 hours alone."" If 80% of Clinton's donations are from new givers, that implies a total number of about 60,000 donations. If we're very generous and assume an average donation of $100, which is high for first-time donors, that gives Clinton a current take of at most $6 million.  Reading the Post's report from its Trail blog, which was by Matthew Mosk, it looks like the over-spin came from Hassan Nemazee, a finance co-chair for Clinton and longtime Democratic fatcat. A Google search shows Nemazee fed the same line to Business Week, which cited him for the news that Clinton supposedly took in $10 million by 2pm this afternoon.  Why am I bothering to knock this particular claim down to size? Because 90% of politics is about perception, and if a campaign is perceived to be running out of money, or floating in money, that affects what other people will think and do about it. Internet-driven fundraising is an amazing thing, because the costs are so low and the speed so seemingly instantaneous. But anyone who reports on it should be careful to remember that the campaigns can easily hype these numbers, and by the time anyone checks for the truth it won't matter.  The same is true, by the way, for the Obama campaign, as Patrick Ruffini has shown that the Obama campaign's online widget showing its donor total has occasionally behaved in odd ways. The best solution to this problem of verifiability, and the lack thereof, would be real-time donation transparency, as was practiced by the Ron Paul campaign. Unfortunately, that's hardly likely from a major campaign any time soon.  [If you're reading this story because of a link from the HuffPost or Fark.com, I've updated my reporting here. It looks like Clinton did rake in $10M as of sometime late yesterday, based on a claimed total of 100,000 donations since Tuesday night.}",0

Today there is a flow of African Americans leaving the poor neighborhoods but not that many.

"http://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=343&sid=1429208  Supreme Court says Americans have right to guns By MARK SHERMAN Associated Press Writer  WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court says Americans have a right to own guns for self-defense and hunting, the justices' first major pronouncement on gun rights in U.S. history.  The court's 5-4 ruling strikes down the District of Columbia's 32-year-old ban on handguns as incompatible with gun rights under the Second Amendment. The decision goes further than even the Bush administration wanted, but probably leaves most firearms laws intact.  The court had not conclusively interpreted the Second Amendment since its ratification in 1791. The amendment reads: ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""  The basic issue for the justices was whether the amendment protects an individual's right to own guns no matter what, or whether that right is somehow tied to service in a state militia.

"Tue Jun 3, 5:00 PM ET    OTTAWA (Reuters) - U.S. soldiers who have deserted the military because of the war in Iraq should be allowed to stay permanently in Canada, the House of Commons voted in a nonbinding motion on Tuesday.  ADVERTISEMENT  The three opposition parties, which together hold a majority of seats in the House, backed a motion that said the government should allow conscientious objectors and their families ""who have refused or left military service related to a war not sanctioned by the United Nations"" to stay in Canada.  Canada was a haven for tens of thousands of draft dodgers during the Vietnam War and has attracted an estimated 175 to 200 Americans who are resisting the Iraq conflict.  ""I think Canada has always been a place which has welcomed those who seek peace and seek freedom,"" Bob Rae, foreign affairs spokesman for the main opposition Liberal Party, told reporters outside the Commons after the vote.  The minority Conservative government opposes the idea, arguing that, unlike during the Vietnam War, the current U.S. military is composed of volunteers, and also that Washington allows people to apply for conscientious objector status.  ""People do not join with their eyes closed. If they do, then they have their own problems,"" Conservative Member of Parliament Laurie Hawn, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Canadian Air Force, said during debate on the motion.  The Supreme Court of Canada refused last November to hear appeals of two U.S. deserters whose applications for refugee status had been turned down by immigration authorities.

"I don't believe that women and men are equal, it is something women are still trying to strive towards this very day.  I don't think it is a matter of time, education or ""playing nice"" but rather lack of experience and setting a higher bar for oneself (demand more). Women need to be more demanding and stand up for what they believe in. There is nothing wrong with having your voice heard or making a man serve you.  In ancient times it was a common thing to have men for slaves, ones that worshipped their goddess. By demanding more from men and holding that power that we truly have but have lost over time (threw greedy white men) it is a matter of regaining and utilizing what we have inside of us.  Being in control doesn't always have to be associated with bdsm or even being a control freak. Control, domination and power can come in many levels. It is a matter of what you want out of your own life and using what you are comfortable with.  All in all, be yourself!",0

Japanese were later convicted of war crimes due to their use of the practice on American POWs.  -During the Vietnam war, US Generals declared the practice illegal and several court martials occurred due to the revelation that the practice was being carried out by US and South Vietnamese troops.   The Imperial Japanese, the Fascist Nazis, the Pinochet regime, the Khmer Rouge, etc have all used waterboarding. And now the US does. Nice company we keep, don't you think?",0

Inspectors would be held up at one gate and could watch convoys of trucks leave at another gate.  The truth in Syria is that North Korea was working with Syria to build nukes - in contravention of their agreement with the U.S. not to do so in return for fuel supplies. That agreement was worked out by one Jimmy Carter under the auspices of the Clinton administration. The North Koreans later admitted that they violated the treaty from the very beginning.",0

False accusations are wrong.Â  Accusations based on circumstance with no proof are wrong.Â  Taking the authority of law into your own hands is wrong.Â  You think they got those lessons?  Most schools have a policy regard handling of cash.Â  I'd guess it was a violation of the policy to keep the money (no matter how small the amount) in an unsecured location at the school.  It could have been another teacher, a janitor or any other adult to take the money -- it could have even been mistakenly mixed up with other papers or thrown out (have you ever seen a teacher's desk in the middle of the day?)  In the public climate that exists regarding 'touching' students these days Im amazed that any educator would even go there.",0

You would expect that with IT so critical to the economy and national security, the Commander-In-Chief would have at least a nodding acquaintance with hacks, viruses, broadband, and such.  He should also know that CERT is not a breath mint.  If there is a generation gap between the majority of the people and Senator McCain, this is another tellingÂ example.

We do alot for the world, and we try to act out of morals and good hearts. I'm serious. We give aid to countries in need, we try to have a equal and fair country, we support values and good will, and we are very optimistic people. We try to be a good force in the world, even though it may not seem like it to you. I'm proud of this country and what it has done for the world, even though it has made some stupid mistakes.

"HOPKINSVILLE, Ky. - A class of third-grade students got a lesson in civil liberties when an envelope containing $5 disappeared from their teacher's desk.  The students at Martin Luther King Elementary in Hopkinsville were asked to remove their shoes and socks during a search. Some were patted down and had their pockets checked. Some parents were angered by the Feb. 15 searches, which did not turn up the missing money at the western Kentucky school. ""The way they treat our students is ridiculous,"" said Zlatko Skuljan, the father of a 9-year-old girl in the class. The school's principal gave written reprimands to four instructors who had physical contact with the students. The principal, Sarah Newman, declined to comment and phone numbers for the four teachers could not be located Wednesday. Christian County Schools spokeswoman Regan Huneycutt said the search violated the school district's policy. School employees can touch students only when the student poses a threat to another student or to themselves. School officials said the search was prompted by the disappearance of an envelope containing $5 for a school function that was on the teacher's desk. The students' regular teacher was absent that day.  http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080227/ap_on_fe_st/odd_students_sea rched;_ylt=ApBpqqqYP5pGKaE8WfSqKPztiBIF",0

ThenÂ down the chain to an IBM Executive, with type bars.  The next shop had correcting Selectrics, until the owner bought me a DECmate for Christmas.  Then secretaries became an endangered species.

Those lazy mother fuckers need a couple more jobs and maybe sell their ass on the street huh?  With the price of tax going up it would pay for YOUR health care. YOU are not paying for anyone else. add it up dumb ass. My husbands parents pay 1700 each a month for their health care. Do you know why it is so high? Because that is how much Kaiser decided to charge them that much, no reason. But with free health care you get so much more. free mental health. free doctors visits. free medicine. free surgery. free dentistry. ect!  Do you have any idea how much, in our current world that would cost to get insurance for? wayy more than we would be paying on taxes a month.  Yes taking the insanely rich More than the poor is a good thing. McCain WANTS to tax the POOR more and give tax cuts to the rich. When I say insanely rich I do not mean like 60 k a year.

It takes a mighty thick tinfoil hat to believe the media is suddenly going to pull the rug out from under him in an effort to give Hillary the nomination.  They might drop the guillotine once the General Election campaign starts, but I honestly doubt they're writing Hillary's obituary as some sort of reverse-psychology to resurrect her campaign with ""underdog"" votes.  Fact is, Hillary is set to win West Virginia by double-figures and has maintained a 20% + lead in opinion polls there for months, well before any of the post-North Carolina ""Hillary is toast"" chatter.  She is also heavily favored to win Kentucky and Puerto Rico by double digits, but if she doesn't keep Oregon close the media will continue to declare Hillary dead in the water.",0

"The following are the Justices on the Supreme Court and which president nominated them:  Chief Justice John Roberts - George W. Bush (considered to be more on the conservative end) Associate Justice John Paul Stevens - Gerald Ford (considered to be one of the more liberal members on the court) Associate Justice Antonin Scalia - Ronald Reagan (considered to be the most conservative on the court) Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy - Ronald Reagan (most moderate on the bench) Associate Justice David Souter - George H.W. Bush (votes with the liberal wing) Associate Justice Clarence Thomas - George H.W. Bush (votes with the conservative wing) Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg - Bill Clinton (one of the more liberal voting justices) Associate Justice Stephen Breyer - Bill Clinton (votes with the liberal wing) Associate Justice Samuel Alito - George W. Bush (considered to be more conservative)  Essentially, this is still a split court. You have 4 conservatives (Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, and Alito) and 4 liberals (Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer).  And then you have the swing vote in Kennedy.  Now please, explain to me how this Supreme Court is a ""Republican controlled Supreme Court.""",0
"   No, no, no...that's not how these tele-evangelists get 100 million bones in the bank and still have the nerve to ask for donations for $36 million Gulfstream jets that cost $6000/month to maintain.  It's the stupid message of ""Give a bunch of money to my ministry and you will be just as rich in return!""  The church I used to go to, which to me was quite unlistenable as the pastor's only message was about he got shot and he's now prosperous as the congregation helped him put a huge downpyment on a Lexus, was nothing but a pit stop for donations.  This was Jesse Duplantis--in trouble with eyeballers of ministry finances all over--message EVERY TIME I begrudgingly saw him.ÃÂ   ""Everyone...stand up!""  ""If you are debt-free....sit down!""  ""Everyone else that's standing...if you want to be rich and prosper...BUY MY BOOKS!""ÃÂ  (WTF???)  After that, it was a bunch of stupid jokes that I'd heard before.  I never had the money to give and I never got the ""you're blessed by what you give"" mantra, because that's just wrong quite frankly, but at least my parents stopped this donation crap once I let them in on the ponzi scheme run by many of these big shots.  Benny Hinn's skank daughter gets a senior summer trip from donations...that was their sign to stop.  It's people's greed on both sides, that's all there is to that.",0

"I respect christopher hitchens for subjecting himself to this to learn more and be more credible when writing about it. This is great journalism. I wish whoever becomes presidnt would have the balls to do this before deciding on it. Even in war it used to be leaders would lead on the field in battle. george washington lead in the field. Today presidents lead wars from air conditioned offices.  Also black journalist need to step up, we should of volunteered for this first and make news on the subject. As a spoken Word artist who wants to write a poem on the subject I am willing to volunteer for it but dont know how to make it happen.  I wonder could I bet hitchens. I think all I would have to do is just hold my breath for 1 minute. How hard could that be? You go under water you can hold your breathe for one minute. Why did it look painless? he said the CIA says about 30 seconds is average for the arabs being subjected to it. We need to see a waterboarding video of the real thing.

"Women have made great strides here in the past few decades, thanks in part to the feminist movement. Women have more opportunities available to them now than they've ever had. (At least in recorded history). They are now able compete in more sports than ever before and they now have equal access to colleges and schools and to most careers. And now with equal access women are showing that they can hang and even outshine the boys. More women than men are going to college and more are graduating and starting new careers. On some campuses almost 70% of the student population is female. Women are taking on more leadership responsibilites and some tests show that women in general make better managers or leaders. Women in their twenties in most large cities in the US are actually making more money than the men in their own age group. A lot of successful women are finding it hard to find a man who makes what they make. More and more, women are actually making more than their husband of boyfriend. I do believe society has become more feminized. Just look at the news with the war in Iraq. Ever since Vietnam, people have begun to question war and the need for it. Women historically have never been in favor of war and most men are becomming that way. I believe Women are definately making a huge mark on history at this very moment and I do believe we will see more of a female influence on leadership, politics, education, etc. etc. etc. where before they never had a voice.",0

"I can't beleive people are still talking about this.... well my theroies... Tarantino was once quizzed about the plaster/band-aid on the back of is neck, he responded by saying that Ving Rhames (Marselius Wallace) has a scar on the back of his neck, it was thought that this would be too distracting as he's a perfectionist and wanted the shot from the back of his head. Whoever made up the Devil-Removing-soul-from-back-of-next-(fact) is laughing his fucking ass of, because that has never been said in ANY documented writtings about Beelezebub (that i've found, feel free to correct me).  As for the contents of the case... Elvis's Gold Suit. Featured in Tarantino's True Romance (i know i know he only wrote it, don't feel free to correct me). Okay so i don't have much in the way of proof but this is Tarantino's quest he creates questions so people keep on talking about it for years to come. Like we're doing now.

"I've found that the people who complain about it being like high school are the same people that went to high school within 25-30 miles of it. That's the problem with a lot of commuter schools, (I grew up near Sacramento State).    I've also found that the people who love it tend to be the one's who get themselves involved. I moved onto campus at CSULB 2 1/2 years ago not knowing a single person -- and now I know plenty of people. I have more friends now than I did in high school and a more active social life for sure. And I was damn busy with my life in high school!        College is what you make it.

"After so many broken promises, integration is key.By Alfred Kokh  from the October 15, 2008 edition  Moscow - It's a truism that stable and friendly relations between two countries require each to look at a situation from the other's point of view. The recent tussle between Russia and the West over Georgia is a stark reminder of how the United States has fundamentally never understood Russia's point of view.  The conventional view is that Russia in recent years has been pushing away from the West. But the reverse is more accurate. The Russia-Georgia conflict is a consequence of the West's ""pushing away"" of Russia.  Russia needed a good friend to stand by her side the past 15 years, to counsel her on becoming an open, democratic country tightly bound to the West. Russia thought it had found a friend in America. Unfortunately, despite the desire of Russia's newly formed leadership to move closer to the West, to be integrated to Western institutions, there was no move to meet Russia partway. All issues of integration were talked away during the many years of negotiations, and all questions of economic aid ended up as miserly loans from the World Bank.  Having worked in Boris Yeltsin's government as a deputy prime minister, I know how the West tried to persuade Russia to take on the entire foreign debt of the former USSR. Russia agreed to take this very difficult step in the hope that the West would appreciate its sacrifice and begin seeing the world through its eyes. Unfortunately that did not happen. Yeltsin's government ended up with almost no allies or supporters in Russia. He was perceived as a puppet of the West, his policies dictated by the US. It should come as no surprise, then, that Vladimir Putin came to power as he did in 1999.  Now, the West considers Prime Minister Putin a foe of democracy. But he was the first to support America after 9/11, and he provided substantial help in organizing operations in Afghanistan. Putin made simple requests in return: membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), dropping visa entry requirements to European Union (EU) countries, and significant cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). All this was promised to him and none of it happened.  Let's imagine for a moment that Russia had been integrated into the West. Then the corruption of the Russian judicial system and its susceptibility to administrative pressure would be balanced by European judicial institutions and the imperfections of its electoral system would be muted by European legislation and the European parliament. The government's economic policies would be in accord with the norms of the EU and WTO and Russia's military independence would be constrained by NATO rules. The human rights situation in Russia would be very different.  The West would only win in this scenario. Instead, it has surrounded Russia with missiles and radar stations and accumulated conventional weapons in close proximity to its borders. It would be naive to expect Russia to make concessions such as ratifying the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty under these conditions. Opinion polls show that promoting pro-Western policies in Russia today without an equivalent response from the West would be political suicide for Russian leaders. Neither the military establishment nor citizens would support such concessions.  The situation in Georgia is a global embarrassment, a tale of contradictions. And, the reaction from Russians and Americans is, simply put, ironic. Russian leaders were crying crocodile tears over the genocide of Ossetians, and voicing outrage over the shelling of Tskhinvali. But they had done the very same thing in Chechnya just a few years ago. The American administration is no better, attacking Iraq for bogus reasons, destroying an entire nation, inciting further religious terrorism, and killing tens of thousands of civilians.  To understand Russia's actions in Georgia, the West must first understand that Russia does not see herself as the losing side that must be punished for the cold war. Second, there is a dangerous historic precedent: In 1919, the Entente forced Germany to sign the humiliating Treaty of Versailles. Historians suggest that the repercussions of that Treaty led to World War II. Had the Allies looked at the situation from the German point of view, history may have taken a better course.  Perhaps the conflict in the Caucasus will at least force the West to talk to Russia about real integration â WTO membership, for example. For if Russia continues to be ""pushed away"" â left alone with its anxieties and the anxieties of its leaders â relations will definitely sour. Do not forget how many nuclear warheads Russia has and how many Russians want to save the country's honor.   â¢ Alfred Kokh is the author of the upcoming book, ""A Crate of Vodka: An Insider View On The 20 Years That Shaped Modern Russia."" He served as a deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin. This text was translated by Antonina W. Bouis.",0

( Anyone feel free to add the transfomation sound effect! ), the whole witwikey background story, and the selling of his gradfathers glasses could have been deleted, and something better put in, I only payed $2.00 to see Transformers, and to be frank it's not even worth $2.00, that would be an insult to the movies that deserve the admition price of $2.00 LOL!",0

"Friday, April 11, 2008   Associated Press WASHINGTONÂ âÂ  The Bush administration is likely to move its research on one of the most contagious animal diseases from an isolated island laboratory to the U.S. mainland near herds of livestock, raising concerns about a catastrophic outbreak. Skeptical Democrats in Congress are demanding to see internal documents they believe highlight the risks and consequences of thedecision. An epidemic of the disease, foot and mouth, which only affectsanimals, could devastate the livestock industry.  One such government report, produced last year and already turned over to lawmakers by the Homeland Security Department, combined commercial satellite images and federal farm data to show the proximity to livestock herds of locations that have been considered for the new lab. ""Would an accidental laboratory release at these locations have the potential to affect nearby livestock?"" asked the nine-page documentÂ· It did not directly answer the question. Read the Rest",0

"http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080610/wl_afp/europeinflationprote stenergytransport  Two truck drivers killed as fuel strike hits hard in Europe  by Olivier Thibault 2 hours, 15 minutes ago  MADRID (AFP) - Two truck drivers were killed on picket lines in Spain and Portugal on Tuesday as strikes by hauliers over soaring fuel prices turned increasingly ugly.    Spanish police escorted petrol tankers into Barcelona as the stoppage, launched Monday, caused food and fuel shortages and huge tailbacks on the Spanish-French border. French railway workers began their own walkout, increasing the transport chaos. A Portuguese driver was killed after he was hit by a truck as he manned a barricade filtering traffic near Alcanena, north of Lisbon. A police spokesman quoted witnesses as saying the 52-year-old man climbed onto the side of a truck in a bid to stop it and fell off under the wheels, Lusa news agency reported. Later Tuesday, a truck driver in southern Spain was run over and killed by a van as he was working on a picket line outside a wholesale market in the southern city of Granada, police said. Other trucks in Portugal and Spain have been stoned or had their windows smashed and tyres punctured for working during the national strikes. Tens of thousands of truckers are on strike or joining the protests to demand government help to offset the higher fuel costs. While new talks with trucker representatives were held in Madrid, authorities in northern Spain ordered emergency measures after many petrol stations in the Catalonia region ran out of fuel. ""Twenty tanker trucks escorted by the regional police left an industrial zone this morning for Barcelona port to help supply and distribute to petrol stations in the region,"" a regional police spokesman told AFP. Forty percent of petrol stations in Catalonia have run out of fuel, according to Manuel Amado, president of the Catalonia Federation of Service Stations. Arrivals of fresh meat, fish and fruit in Madrid have come to a near halt, according to officials at the Mercamadrid market, Spain's biggest wholesale market. They said that fish would be in short supply from Thursday but stocks of other foods should last until the end of the week. Automakers in Spain said most of the country's automobile plants, including those of Nissan, Mercedes Benz, Seat and Renault, have had to cut or halt production. Auto plants are particularly vulnerable to a strike by hauliers, which provide them with spare parts. Truckers stopped lorries from crossing the French-Spain border and caused major tailbacks around major Spanish cities, including Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. Spanish and French truckers staged pickets on either side of the frontier between the two countries. They blocked a bridge on the border at Bidassoa in the western Basque region and other main crossing points. On the French side, service areas on motorways were packed with trucks from the border right back to Bordeaux, about 200 kilometres (125 miles) away. Spain's second largest hauliers' union Fenadismer, which claims to represent 70,000 out of Spain's 380,000 truck drivers, launched an open-ended strike on Monday. Talks Monday between the hauliers and the government ended in failure, Fenadismer said. The Portuguese government said it hoped to have an agreement with its truckers by the end of the week. A separate strike by workers at the French rail company, SNCF, severely hit rail traffic. About half of intercity and local commuter trains were running along with about three quarters of TGV high speed trains from Paris to southwest France. Some express commuter lines into Paris were badly affected by the strike.

"  The Supreme Court is completely independent, and was designed that way. The only time that any partisanship has an influence is when the confirmations are taking place.  So tell me, how exactly can any President, party, or politician have ANY influence over a member in the Supreme Court? What can they do? The Justice is nominated for LIFE. What could any party or politician possibly offer to a sitting Supreme Court Justice, when that Justice has a guaranteed job no matter who's in power, and no matter what their decision is?  Think about the 2000 election for a second. What did the Justices who voted to stop the recount (let's remember that the case wasn't about the Supreme Court voting for one candidate or another....if you really think that, please reread the decision) have to gain from doing so? What motive could Justice Scalia and then Chief Justice Rehnquist possibly have in ensuring that one party or another, or one president or another, came to power? Do you know what would have happened to all the sitting ""conservative"" Justices if Gore had won instead? NOTHING. So how did the party have any influence over their decision?",0

"  i have voted and i have failed to vote in the past and i can see why people are getting discouraged about voting. most of the time the candidates you vote in simply disregard what the people want. they often seem more interested in servicing special interests, people who are funded by power groups.  and if you live in a state like texas and you want to vote dem in a presidential election, you can pretty well be assured your vote is meaningless. the same is true if you want to vote gop in new york. so i am for moving toward a popular vote system.  if an i.d. is required to vote, so what? that seems like a reasonable requirement, to prove who you are and that you are only voting once.",0

"Yes, I've cited those figures. Think about it. Thats two giant institutions holding 24% of volatile debt, pooling it with other mortgages, and selling it off as safe with a wink that its backed by the U.S. government. Plus, these two companies didn't have the same transparency of information rules that other private companies were held to. That is a giant risk.  Although the remaining 76% is held privately. That 76% is probably split up between more than one or two organizations. That mitigates risk. Furthermore, when these private companies were pooling the mortgages they wouldn't be able imply that their bonds would be backed by the U.S. government.",0

It's so easy for some people to call someone a coward, when they themselves sit on their easy chair and pontificate about war and other races/religions that they know next to nothing about. They have never fought in a war or even been in the military yet deem to know it all. Till you have faced the stress and horror of war, how do you know how it would affect even you? I would suspect that the ones that have come across our border to stay had no idea that they would be fighting an illegal war and coming here is their only way out.  I remember the wave that came during the Vietnam war and met some that came to BC. They were broken and suffering men that couldn't even talk of the horrors they had seen.

Americans grow up without many ""outside"" influences in the media - I would say that 98 percent of your television and film content is American made, american produced, directed, acted..... most of the music that gets commercial airplay in the states are also very much american dominated. Also, geographically, america is quite isolated, really.... sure, britain is an island, but it's only a hop skip and a jump to about 20 different countries...",0

Loving you is the only thing that makes my life worth living.,1
"The world might call me crazy, but I'm glad to be crazy about you! My sweetheart, I love you!",1
Loving you has become a must for me. It is no longer a choice or option.,1
"If there's one thing in this world I'm afraid to lose, it's you. I am so in love with you that I can't afford to lose you!",1
You turned my life into a journey of love and happiness. Every second I spend with you; I fall in love even more with you!,1
"If you ask me when I want to be with you, my answer will be - now and forever.",1
No matter what has happened. No matter what you've done. No matter what you will do. I will always love you.,1
You don't know how blessed I am to have you in life. You have given a new meaning to my life. Love you.,1
I wish to be everything that brings a smile on your face and happiness to your heart. I want to love you like no one else ever did!,1

I love you- this is the least I can say. I wish I could do more to actually show what I really feel for you.,1
They say love can't be seen; it can only be felt. But they were wrong. I have seen it many times. I have seen true love for me in your eyes. And it's the most beautiful thing I have ever seen!,1
"I loved you, I love you and I will love you forever.",1
Your love is everything that keeps me alive and makes me feel complete. I love you!,1
Words are not enough to say thanks to you for being with me. You are the kindest soul who makes my life beautiful and loved.,1
My greatest fantasies are the ones that start with you and end with you. I love you truly madly and deeply!,1
Thank you for being my wife; thanks for giving me many reasons to live my life to the fullest. You are my perfect one.,1
"Waking up next to you every day is nothing but a pure blessing. You have my whole heart, sunshine. Thank you for being my husband.",1
